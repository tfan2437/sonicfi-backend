    biography:
      'One of the most acclaimed artists of his generation, hip-hop or otherwise, Kendrick Lamar is known for his top-tier lyricism, virtuosic microphone command, and sharp conceptual vision. His talents have translated to a rare combination of continuous chart feats and critical acclaim, plus respect and support from the rappers who paved the way for his advancement. The Compton native started in his teens and hit his creative and commercial stride in the 2010s, during which he authored the multi-platinum good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), followed up with the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and scaled another new height with the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017). All three displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and riveting narratives with an assertion of artistic dominance, examination of internal conflict, and upliftment of community all centered. Those qualities were also exemplified in seven concurrent Top 40 singles that included "Swimming Pools (Drank)," "i," and the Hot 100-topping "HUMBLE." Lamar\'s screenplay-level detail on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of associates, many of whom -- from inspirations <a href="spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:4XqfpACObRB5AsBcUYjL8X">MC Eiht</a> to peers such as Sounwave, <a href="spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw">Thundercat</a> -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper\'s cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive-production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the source of three additional Top 40 hits. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense self-analysis, became Lamar\'s sixth number one on the Billboard 200 despite containing his most challenging and confrontational work. The lean surprise release GNX (2024) capped a year in which Lamar topped the Hot 100 again with "Like That" (a collaboration with <a href="spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i">Future</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp">Metro Boomin</a>) and the Grammy-sweeping "Not Like Us" (the peak of a public feud with <a href="spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4">Drake</a>).  \r\n\nCompton, California native Kendrick Lamar Duckworth grew up immersed in hip-hop culture and surrounded by gang activity. As a youngster, he gradually discovered an aptitude for writing stories, poems, and lyrics, which naturally led to rapping. He made a name for himself as K. Dot. At the age of 16 in 2003, he issued his debut mixtape, The Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year. While it merely hinted at the potential of the then-teenager, it was impressive enough to catch the attention of <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg+Entertainment%22">Top Dawg Entertainment</a> and led to a long-term association with the label that steadily propelled his career. Training Day, the <a href="spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3">Jay Rock</a> collaboration No Sleep \'til NYC, and C4, issued from 2005 through 2009, likewise preceded Lamar\'s decision to go by his first and middle names. The last of the three was issued the same year he became part of <a href="spotify:artist:7a9KRWdaSZktpGGnWndzbC">Black Hippy</a>, a group whose members -- including fellow <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22">TDE</a> artists <a href="spotify:artist:0g9vAlRPK9Gt3FKCekk4TW">Ab-Soul</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3">Jay Rock</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:5IcR3N7QB1j6KBL8eImZ8m">ScHoolboy Q</a> -- frequently appeared on one another\'s mixtapes and albums. \r\n\nThe first tape credited to Kendrick Lamar was Overly Dedicated, released in September 2010. Also the rapper\'s first commercial release, it reached enough listeners to enter Billboard\'s R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After XXL magazine selected him for the 2011 Freshman Class feature, Lamar released his first official album, Section.80, that July, and crossed into the Billboard 200, reaching number 113. With deeper conceptual narratives and sharpened melodic hooks, as well as comparative multidimensional development from primary producer Sounwave, the set acted as a kind of warning flare for Lamar\'s mainstream rap dominance. In addition to the dozens of tracks he had appeared on by then, Lamar had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a concert later in 2011, <a href="spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:0NbfKEOTQCcwd6o7wSDOHI">Game</a> dubbed him "The New King of the West Coast," a notion <a href="spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7">Dre</a> endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar to his <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22">Interscope</a>-affiliated <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22Aftermath%22">Aftermath</a> label. \r\n\nLamar\'s major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 and entered the Billboard 200 at number two. Three of its singles -- "Swimming Pools (Drank)," "Poetic Justice," and "Bitch Don\'t Kill My Vibe" -- reached the Top Ten of Billboard\'s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart and went Top 40 pop. More significantly, the album showcased Lamar as an exceptional storyteller capable of making compelling concept albums. It led to Grammy nominations in four categories: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Rap Album, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (for "Now or Never," a deluxe edition bonus cut featuring <a href="spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr">Mary J. Blige</a>). <a href="spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK">Miguel</a>\'s "How Many Drinks?" and <a href="spotify:artist:13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca">A$AP Rocky</a>\'s "Fuckin\' Problems," two tracks on which Lamar made guest appearances, were nominated as well.  \r\n\nRather than rest, Lamar remained active during 2013-2014, touring as well as appearing on tracks by the likes of <a href="spotify:artist:5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb">Tame Impala</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:0A0FS04o6zMoto8OKPsDwY">YG</a>, and fellow <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg%22">Top Dawg</a> affiliate <a href="spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP">SZA</a>. The proud single "i" was released in September of the latter year, became Lamar\'s fourth Top 40 single, and won Grammys for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. Still rolling, he announced in early 2015 that his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, would be out in March with tracks featuring <a href="spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:4jCbgl5Dmt3uOh8WRQfpPs">Bilal</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw">Thundercat</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:2GVBp7QyHckoOg7rYkLvrA">George Clinton</a>. A technical error caused the digital version to be released eight days early, but the LP nonetheless topped the Billboard 200 with sales of 325,000 copies within its first week. It made numerous best-of lists at the end of the year and won the Grammy for Best Rap Album. The defiant and life-affirming "Alright," which was quickly adopted by the Black Lives Matter activist movement, along with another single, "These Walls," took awards for Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Riding high on his wins and a striking Grammy ceremony performance, Lamar followed up in March 2016 with untitled unmastered., consisting of demos recorded during the previous three years. Like the preceding release, it debuted at number one, and seamlessly synthesized beatmaking and traditional musicianship from the likes of Sounwave, <a href="spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw">Thundercat</a>. Within a month, Lamar added to his ever-lengthening discography of featured appearances with his contribution to <a href="spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m">Beyonc√©</a>\'s "Freedom."\r\n\nLed by "HUMBLE.," his first number one pop hit, DAMN. arrived in April 2017 and likewise entered the Billboard 200 at the top. Remarkably, all 14 of the album\'s songs entered the Hot 100, and it was certified multi-platinum within three months. Among the contributors were <a href="spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H">Rihanna</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ">U2</a>, but at this point, the supporting roles were beneficial more for the guest artists than they were for Lamar, whose artistic clout was unrivaled. He snagged five more Grammys: DAMN. won Best Rap Album; "HUMBLE." took Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Video; and Best Rap/Sung Performance went to "LOYALTY.," the <a href="spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H">Rihanna</a> collaboration. Another number one hit followed in February 2018. The soundtrack Black Panther: The Album featured Lamar on every track. Its three singles -- "All the Stars" (with <a href="spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP">SZA</a>), "King\'s Dead" (with <a href="spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3">Jay Rock</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i">Future</a>), and "Pray for Me" (with <a href="spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ">the Weeknd</a>) -- eventually hit the Top 40. That April, DAMN. won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. It was the first time the judges recognized a work outside the genres of classical and jazz. Months later, "King\'s Dead" made Lamar a 13-time Grammy winner when it took the award for Best Rap Performance. "All the Stars" alone was nominated in four categories, while Black Panther was up for Album of the Year. The film itself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. \r\n\nAfter some time away from music that included an acting role in the fifth season of the Starz network series Power, Lamar resurfaced in August 2021 on cousin <a href="spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1">Baby Keem</a>\'s "Family Ties." The single, a highlight of The Melodic Blue, <a href="spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1">Keem</a>\'s album debut for Lamar and Dave Free\'s new <a href="spotify:search:label%3A%22pgLang%22">pgLang</a> label, won Best Rap Performance at the following Grammys. Lamar then performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside hip-hop royalty that included <a href="spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR">Eminem</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr">Mary J. Blige</a>. \r\n\nIn May 2022, Lamar issued "The Heart, Pt. 5" as a ruminative prelude to his fifth full-length. An emotionally complex and raw double album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers landed later that month and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. In addition to <a href="spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1">Keem</a>, the likes of <a href="spotify:artist:2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm">Sampha</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:46SHBwWsqBkxI7EeeBEQG7">Kodak Black</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y">Portishead</a>\'s <a href="spotify:artist:6Lt6KFXX3P0v6vfrynQAMo">Beth Gibbons</a> made featured appearances. It was named Best Rap Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, where "The Heart, Pt. 5" took the awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. Also in 2023, he was featured on <a href="spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m">Beyonc√©</a>\'s single "America Has a Problem."\r\n\nIn 2024, Lamar was part of a well-publicized feud with <a href="spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4">Drake</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5">J. Cole</a>. After <a href="spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5">Cole</a> had named the three as the "big three" greatest rappers in modern hip-hop, Lamar asserted that he was the only one during his guest verse on <a href="spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i">Future</a> and <a href="spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp">Metro Boomin</a>\'s song "Like That," which topped the Billboard Hot 100. <a href="spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5">Cole</a> then criticized Lamar on his song "7 Minute Drill," which was met with a poor reception; <a href="spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5">Cole</a> apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. In April, <a href="spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4">Drake</a> released two diss tracks against Lamar, who responded with the vitriolic "Euphoria" and "6:16 in L.A." After another exchange of diss tracks, Lamar again returned fire with "Not Like Us," a collaboration with <a href="spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k">Mustard</a> that broke single-day streaming records, topped the Hot 100, and earned Grammy nominations in five categories. That November, with no advance notice, Lamar released his sixth album, GNX. Sounwave and <a href="spotify:artist:414TS3VqZf1XPCBixdmX9n">Jack Antonoff</a> co-produced each track with variable assistance from the likes of <a href="spotify:artist:6HQYnRM4OzToCYPpVBInuU">Kamasi Washington</a>, <a href="spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href="spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k">Mustard</a>. At the 2025 Grammy Awards, he swept his five nominated categories, taking home Record of the Year and Song of the Year. A week after that ceremony, he headlined the Super Bowl LIX halftime show. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi',

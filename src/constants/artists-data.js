    "biography": "One of the most acclaimed artists of his generation, hip-hop or otherwise, Kendrick Lamar is known for his top-tier lyricism, virtuosic microphone command, and sharp conceptual vision. His talents have translated to a rare combination of continuous chart feats and critical acclaim, plus respect and support from the rappers who paved the way for his advancement. The Compton native started in his teens and hit his creative and commercial stride in the 2010s, during which he authored the multi-platinum good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), followed up with the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and scaled another new height with the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017). All three displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and riveting narratives with an assertion of artistic dominance, examination of internal conflict, and upliftment of community all centered. Those qualities were also exemplified in seven concurrent Top 40 singles that included \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" \"i,\" and the Hot 100-topping \"HUMBLE.\" Lamar's screenplay-level detail on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of associates, many of whom -- from inspirations <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XqfpACObRB5AsBcUYjL8X\">MC Eiht</a> to peers such as Sounwave, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a> -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive-production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the source of three additional Top 40 hits. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense self-analysis, became Lamar's sixth number one on the Billboard 200 despite containing his most challenging and confrontational work. The lean surprise release GNX (2024) capped a year in which Lamar topped the Hot 100 again with \"Like That\" (a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>) and the Grammy-sweeping \"Not Like Us\" (the peak of a public feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>).  \r\n\nCompton, California native Kendrick Lamar Duckworth grew up immersed in hip-hop culture and surrounded by gang activity. As a youngster, he gradually discovered an aptitude for writing stories, poems, and lyrics, which naturally led to rapping. He made a name for himself as K. Dot. At the age of 16 in 2003, he issued his debut mixtape, The Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year. While it merely hinted at the potential of the then-teenager, it was impressive enough to catch the attention of <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg+Entertainment%22\">Top Dawg Entertainment</a> and led to a long-term association with the label that steadily propelled his career. Training Day, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a> collaboration No Sleep 'til NYC, and C4, issued from 2005 through 2009, likewise preceded Lamar's decision to go by his first and middle names. The last of the three was issued the same year he became part of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7a9KRWdaSZktpGGnWndzbC\">Black Hippy</a>, a group whose members -- including fellow <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a> artists <a href=\"spotify:artist:0g9vAlRPK9Gt3FKCekk4TW\">Ab-Soul</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5IcR3N7QB1j6KBL8eImZ8m\">ScHoolboy Q</a> -- frequently appeared on one another's mixtapes and albums. \r\n\nThe first tape credited to Kendrick Lamar was Overly Dedicated, released in September 2010. Also the rapper's first commercial release, it reached enough listeners to enter Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After XXL magazine selected him for the 2011 Freshman Class feature, Lamar released his first official album, Section.80, that July, and crossed into the Billboard 200, reaching number 113. With deeper conceptual narratives and sharpened melodic hooks, as well as comparative multidimensional development from primary producer Sounwave, the set acted as a kind of warning flare for Lamar's mainstream rap dominance. In addition to the dozens of tracks he had appeared on by then, Lamar had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a concert later in 2011, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NbfKEOTQCcwd6o7wSDOHI\">Game</a> dubbed him \"The New King of the West Coast,\" a notion <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dre</a> endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar to his <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a>-affiliated <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Aftermath%22\">Aftermath</a> label. \r\n\nLamar's major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 and entered the Billboard 200 at number two. Three of its singles -- \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" \"Poetic Justice,\" and \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\" -- reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart and went Top 40 pop. More significantly, the album showcased Lamar as an exceptional storyteller capable of making compelling concept albums. It led to Grammy nominations in four categories: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Rap Album, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (for \"Now or Never,\" a deluxe edition bonus cut featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>). <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a>'s \"How Many Drinks?\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca\">A$AP Rocky</a>'s \"Fuckin' Problems,\" two tracks on which Lamar made guest appearances, were nominated as well.  \r\n\nRather than rest, Lamar remained active during 2013-2014, touring as well as appearing on tracks by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb\">Tame Impala</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0A0FS04o6zMoto8OKPsDwY\">YG</a>, and fellow <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg%22\">Top Dawg</a> affiliate <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a>. The proud single \"i\" was released in September of the latter year, became Lamar's fourth Top 40 single, and won Grammys for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. Still rolling, he announced in early 2015 that his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, would be out in March with tracks featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4jCbgl5Dmt3uOh8WRQfpPs\">Bilal</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2GVBp7QyHckoOg7rYkLvrA\">George Clinton</a>. A technical error caused the digital version to be released eight days early, but the LP nonetheless topped the Billboard 200 with sales of 325,000 copies within its first week. It made numerous best-of lists at the end of the year and won the Grammy for Best Rap Album. The defiant and life-affirming \"Alright,\" which was quickly adopted by the Black Lives Matter activist movement, along with another single, \"These Walls,\" took awards for Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Riding high on his wins and a striking Grammy ceremony performance, Lamar followed up in March 2016 with untitled unmastered., consisting of demos recorded during the previous three years. Like the preceding release, it debuted at number one, and seamlessly synthesized beatmaking and traditional musicianship from the likes of Sounwave, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a>. Within a month, Lamar added to his ever-lengthening discography of featured appearances with his contribution to <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>'s \"Freedom.\"\r\n\nLed by \"HUMBLE.,\" his first number one pop hit, DAMN. arrived in April 2017 and likewise entered the Billboard 200 at the top. Remarkably, all 14 of the album's songs entered the Hot 100, and it was certified multi-platinum within three months. Among the contributors were <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ\">U2</a>, but at this point, the supporting roles were beneficial more for the guest artists than they were for Lamar, whose artistic clout was unrivaled. He snagged five more Grammys: DAMN. won Best Rap Album; \"HUMBLE.\" took Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Video; and Best Rap/Sung Performance went to \"LOYALTY.,\" the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> collaboration. Another number one hit followed in February 2018. The soundtrack Black Panther: The Album featured Lamar on every track. Its three singles -- \"All the Stars\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a>), \"King's Dead\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>), and \"Pray for Me\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>) -- eventually hit the Top 40. That April, DAMN. won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. It was the first time the judges recognized a work outside the genres of classical and jazz. Months later, \"King's Dead\" made Lamar a 13-time Grammy winner when it took the award for Best Rap Performance. \"All the Stars\" alone was nominated in four categories, while Black Panther was up for Album of the Year. The film itself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. \r\n\nAfter some time away from music that included an acting role in the fifth season of the Starz network series Power, Lamar resurfaced in August 2021 on cousin <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Baby Keem</a>'s \"Family Ties.\" The single, a highlight of The Melodic Blue, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Keem</a>'s album debut for Lamar and Dave Free's new <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22pgLang%22\">pgLang</a> label, won Best Rap Performance at the following Grammys. Lamar then performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside hip-hop royalty that included <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>. \r\n\nIn May 2022, Lamar issued \"The Heart, Pt. 5\" as a ruminative prelude to his fifth full-length. An emotionally complex and raw double album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers landed later that month and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. In addition to <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Keem</a>, the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm\">Sampha</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:46SHBwWsqBkxI7EeeBEQG7\">Kodak Black</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Lt6KFXX3P0v6vfrynQAMo\">Beth Gibbons</a> made featured appearances. It was named Best Rap Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, where \"The Heart, Pt. 5\" took the awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. Also in 2023, he was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>'s single \"America Has a Problem.\"\r\n\nIn 2024, Lamar was part of a well-publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a>. After <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> had named the three as the \"big three\" greatest rappers in modern hip-hop, Lamar asserted that he was the only one during his guest verse on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s song \"Like That,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> then criticized Lamar on his song \"7 Minute Drill,\" which was met with a poor reception; <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. In April, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> released two diss tracks against Lamar, who responded with the vitriolic \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in L.A.\" After another exchange of diss tracks, Lamar again returned fire with \"Not Like Us,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k\">Mustard</a> that broke single-day streaming records, topped the Hot 100, and earned Grammy nominations in five categories. That November, with no advance notice, Lamar released his sixth album, GNX. Sounwave and <a href=\"spotify:artist:414TS3VqZf1XPCBixdmX9n\">Jack Antonoff</a> co-produced each track with variable assistance from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6HQYnRM4OzToCYPpVBInuU\">Kamasi Washington</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k\">Mustard</a>. At the 2025 Grammy Awards, he swept his five nominated categories, taking home Record of the Year and Song of the Year. A week after that ceremony, he headlined the Super Bowl LIX halftime show. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi"

    "biography": "Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar, amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production inspired as much by Tim McGraw as Kanye West. After the release of his 2015 quintuple-platinum single &#34;White Iverson,&#34; off his debut, Stoney, he quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers &#34;Rockstar&#34; with 21 Savage and &#34;Psycho&#34; with Ty Dolla $ign from 2018&#39;s Grammy-nominated Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history, &#34;Sunflower&#34; with Swae Lee, from 2019&#39;s pop-leaning Hollywood&#39;s Bleeding. After dialing things back with 2022&#39;s vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023&#39;s Austin."

    "biography": "Houston-born rapper and producer Travis Scott's psychedelic trap style makes him one of the more distinctive talents to have risen to the height of mainstream commercial popularity. His heavily processed, half-sung/half-rapped style set him apart early on, and he grew from affiliations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s GOOD Music and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Grand+Hustle%22\">Grand Hustle</a> in the early 2010s to chart-dominating popularity before the close of the decade. After his first studio album, 2015's Rodeo, debuted in the number three position, Scott followed with a pair of number one full-lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018), all the while assisting on platinum singles headlined by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> (\"Bitch Better Have My Money\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a> (\"Love Galore\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> (\"Portland\"), and working extensively with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a> as <a href=\"spotify:artist:6extd4B6hl8VTmnlhpl2bY\">Huncho Jack</a>. Whether leading or supporting, Scott's presence was unmistakable, and he quickly accumulated Grammys, endorsement deals, and appearances in more than 80 charting songs. By the 2020s, Scott was one of the most successful living artists on the planet. This level of fame played into both extreme success and profound tragedy, with Scott being at the center of controversy surrounding the deaths and injuries of hundreds of fans at his 2021 Astroworld festival before debuting his genre-crossing, Grammy-nominated fourth album, 2023's UTOPIA. He was then featured on a variety of tracks with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3a1tBryiczPAZpgoZN9Rzg\">Asake</a>, and others.\r\n\nBorn Jacques Webster, Travis Scott grew up in a suburb of Houston and began making music as a teenager. He formed a duo called the Graduates with Chris Holloway, and they released an EP in 2009. The following year, he formed another duo, the Classmates, with OG Chess. Scott produced the pair's two full-lengths, Buddy Rich and Cruis'n USA, but they broke up near the end of 2011. After dropping out of college, Scott moved to Los Angeles and began recording music on his own. He met <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a> and eventually <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>. Scott was hired as an in-house producer for GOOD Music, and appeared on the label's Cruel Summer compilation in 2012. Scott's debut, Owl Pharaoh, was originally scheduled to be released as a free mixtape in 2012, but as his profile grew (including a placement in XXL Magazine's Freshman Class of 2013), and sample clearance issues, the album wasn't released until May 2013. Featuring guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:17lzZA2AlOHwCwFALHttmp\">2 Chainz</a> (on the single \"Upper Echelon\") as well as <a href=\"spotify:artist:6O4EGCCb6DoIiR6B1QCQgp\">Toro y Moi</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13rHmjtJmlIJ2aDyJc7CLV\">Justin Vernon</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ\">Bon Iver</a>, Owl Pharaoh eventually garnered a nomination for Best Mixtape at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. \r\n\nThe buildup to Scott's first proper studio album involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles \"Don't Play\" and \"Mamacita,\" and the March 2015 U.S. Rodeo Tour, headlined by Scott and supported by <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>. Several of the dates sold out. The same month, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>'s Scott-produced hit single \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" was released. \"3500\" and \"Antidote\" were issued ahead of Rodeo, Scott's second full-length, which followed in September on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Grand+Hustle%22\">Grand Hustle</a>/Epic and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Toward the end of the year, \"Antidote\" peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 and became Scott's first platinum single. \r\n\nChatter regarding a follow-up, along with numerous delays, ensued throughout much of 2016. Meanwhile, Scott extended his commercial presence with featured spots on <a href=\"spotify:artist:137W8MRPWKqSmrBGDBFSop\">Wiz Khalifa</a>'s \"Bake Sale,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>'s \"Woo,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s \"FML,\" as well as a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, \"Pick Up the Phone,\" a mid-year hit issued as the lead single of <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>'s JEFFERY. Three months later, after \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" earned platinum certification, Scott's second proper album arrived. Titled Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight after one of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>'s lines in \"Pick Up the Phone,\" the woozy, mostly midtempo set featured that hit and contributions from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:74V3dE1a51skRkdII8y2C6\">André 3000</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>. It went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. \r\n\nLeading up to his third LP, Scott was featured on a slew of tracks, including platinum singles headlined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a> (\"Love Galore\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> (\"Portland\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a> (\"Sky Walker\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:17lzZA2AlOHwCwFALHttmp\">2 Chainz</a> (\"4 AM\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a> (\"Dark Knight Dummo\"). Scott's own \"Butterfly Effect\" arrived during this torrent of hits in May 2017 and promptly went platinum as well. Seven months later, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, a collaborative full-length with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, entered the Billboard 200 at number three. The following May, Scott released \"Watch,\" a non-album track featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and within three months released Astroworld, which he considered the true follow-up to Rodeo. Featuring \"Butterfly Effect,\" the album -- named after a demolished Houston amusement park -- debuted at number one and was supported with a second single, \"Sicko Mode.\" Scott closed out 2018 by appearing on multiple tracks of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s Not All Heroes Wear Capes album. \r\n\nAfter collaborating with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a> on 2019's \"The London\" and being featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>'s \"Antisocial,\" Scott issued his own solo single, \"Highest in the Room.\" JackBoys, a brief compilation showcasing artists from Scott's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Cactus+Jack+Records%22\">Cactus Jack Records</a> label, appeared at the end of the year. The release subsequently became the first number one album of the 2020s. Another <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> collaboration, \"Franchise,\" also featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QJIPDAEDILuo8AIq3pMuU\">M.I.A.</a>, debuted in September 2020 on top of the Billboard 200. \r\n\nIn January 2021, Spanish DJ <a href=\"spotify:artist:2o08sCWF5yyo2G4DCiT7T9\">HVME</a> released a deep house reworking of Scott and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s song \"Goosebumps,\" eventually topping Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs Chart. Two more tracks appeared that November, with both \"Escape Plan\" and \"Mafia\" arriving concurrently and hitting the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \r\n\nOn November 5, 2021, there was a fatal crowd crush during Scott's performance at his third annual Astroworld Festival in Houston, Texas. The event resulted in the death of 10 people with over 300 being treated for injuries. The rapper apologized and the rest of the festival was canceled. Scott and others involved in the festival were investigated, though a Texas grand jury ultimately declined to indict them. \r\n\nIn May 2022, Scott performed at the Billboard Music Awards, his first live appearance since the Astroworld Festival tragedy. He also contributed to four tracks on <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s Heroes & Villains album. In July 2023, he released his fourth studio album, UTOPIA. An ambitious, genre-crossing concept album in the vein of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s Yeezus, it featured a bevy of producers, including Scott, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, WondaGurl, and others. Also featured were many guests, such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> on the lead single, \"K-pop,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ\">Bon Iver</a> on \"Delresto (Echoes).\" UTOPIA topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. Scott's work throughout much of 2024 largely consisted of features on records by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k\">Mustard</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3a1tBryiczPAZpgoZN9Rzg\">Asake</a>. ~ Paul Simpson & Andy Kellman, Rovi"

    "biography": "With her four-octave vocal acrobatics and iconic image, American singer, songwriter, and actress Ariana Grande has solidified her place as one of the quintessential pop stars of her generation, racking up stacks of awards and chart records in the process. Emerging in the early 2010s with the hit single \"The Way,\" Grande was primed to follow in the footsteps of her biggest influences, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6XpaIBNiVzIetEPCWDvAFP\">Whitney Houston</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>, due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its <a href=\"spotify:artist:3aVoqlJOYx31lH1gibGDt3\">Babyface</a> production, her debut, Yours Truly, underscored her debt to '90s R&B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her sound. \"Problem,\" a 2014 smash duet with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5yG7ZAZafVaAlMTeBybKAL\">Iggy Azalea</a>, was the first indication of her development, an evolution reinforced by the hits \"Bang Bang\" and \"Love Me Harder.\" Grande maintained her popularity with 2016's Dangerous Woman, then really hit her stride with 2018's Sweetener and its swift sequel, Thank U, Next, whose title track sat atop the U.S. singles chart for seven weeks. That achievement was quickly equaled by the album's glitzy second single, \"7 Rings,\" and later with \"Positions,\" the lead single from 2020's R&B-heavy album of the same name. After four years without an album -- a relative eternity considering her turn-of-the-decade blitz -- Grande returned with Eternal Sunshine, which she recorded while shooting the film version of Broadway's Wicked.\r\n\nA native of Boca Raton, Florida, where she was born in 1993 to graphic designer Edward Butera and Joan Grande (the CEO of Hose-McCann Communications), Grande began singing and acting at an early age, appearing in local theater productions. In 2008, when she was 15, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, and she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 <a href=\"spotify:artist:7KgW65389e5w4xWzaVOuCg\">Desmond Child</a>-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande's Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam & Cat, which also starred <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AoFRPmkjP1WTi2Zu7gbZV\">Jennette McCurdy</a> of iCarly.\r\n\nAs she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record with the soundtrack to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single \"Put Your Hearts Up,\" which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with \"The Way,\" her 2013 single featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LLpKhyESsyAXpc4laK94U\">Mac Miller</a>. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in \"Baby I\" and \"Right There.\"\r\n\nAt the end of the year, she released a seasonal EP called Christmas Kisses, but her real efforts went into the recording of her second album, My Everything. Preceded by the single \"Problem\" -- a song that featured a guest spot from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5yG7ZAZafVaAlMTeBybKAL\">Iggy Azalea</a>, the \"It girl\" of the summer of 2014; it peaked at two on the U.S. charts and was certified double platinum -- the album featured a host of different producers, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, Shellback, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4we5S2VLjgY9KzIzApL1KI\">Ryan Tedder</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>. It was released at the end of August 2014, hitting number one on charts across the globe. Subsequent singles featured assists by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2qxJFvFYMEDqd7ui6kSAcq\">Zedd</a> (\"Break Free\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:2gsggkzM5R49q6jpPvazou\">Jessie J</a> & <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a> (\"Bang Bang\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> (\"Love Me Harder\"). At one point in 2014, three of her songs were in the Billboard Top Ten at the same time, a feat matched only by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY\">Adele</a>. By the time fifth single \"One Last Time\" charted in early 2015, My Everything had sold nearly 600,000 copies. \r\n\nAs that album's cycle wound down, Grande guest-starred on Ryan Murphy's campy slasher series Scream Queens and she also recorded another holiday EP, Christmas & Chill. In October 2015, Grande released the single \"Focus,\" which debuted at number seven on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum the following January. That February, she announced her third album, Dangerous Woman, and released the album's title track as a single in March. The song hit number eight on the Hot 100, making Grande the first artist to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the Top Ten. Featuring collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ylR3zwA0zaapAu94fktwa\">Macy Gray</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, the album appeared in May 2016 and debuted at number two. It eventually went platinum, helped by a trio of Top Ten hits and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Grande began 2017 by duetting with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5y2Xq6xcjJb2jVM54GHK3t\">John Legend</a> on \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the title track for <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Disney%22\">Disney</a>'s live-action remake of the 1991 animated classic. She then mounted her Dangerous Woman Tour, performing across North America and Europe during the first half of 2017. \r\n\nTragedy struck on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber attacked Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. Grande returned to performing on June 4, when she held a star-studded charity concert called One Love Manchester to aid the victims of the bombing. Following the show, she resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour, which concluded in Hong Kong that September.\r\n\nIn April 2018, Grande kicked off promotion for her fourth album, Sweetener, by issuing the single \"No Tears Left to Cry,\" which debuted at number three on the Hot 100. It was followed by \"God Is a Woman\" later that year. Upon its release in August 2018, Sweetener debuted at number one in both the U.S. and U.K. \r\n\nThree months after the release of Sweetener, Grande returned with the non-LP single \"Thank U, Next.\" Quickly becoming an internet sensation, \"Thank U, Next\" shot to number one throughout the world, as did Grande's next single, \"7 Rings.\" Both songs were featured on the full-length album Thank U, Next, which appeared in February 2019. Her fourth U.S. number one, the set also topped the charts in over a dozen countries, further buoyed by third single \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored.\" Mere months after the release of Thank U, Next, Grande moved on with a series of collaborations, including \"Monopoly\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:63XBtGSEZINSyXylZxEUbv\">Victoria Monet</a>, \"Boyfriend\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5UjifI1TYefXWn9GdqDOHl\">Social House</a>, and the Charlie's Angels reboot theme \"Don't Call Me Angel\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5YGY8feqx7naU7z4HrwZM6\">Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa\">Lana Del Rey</a>. Capping off the year, Grande was nominated for five Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Thank U, Next, Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"7 Rings,\" and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Boyfriend.\" She capped this prolific period with k bye for now, a live album recorded at various stops throughout her 2019 Sweetener World Tour.\r\n\nGrande had duets reach the top of the Billboard charts in early 2020 -- first it was \"Stuck with U\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, then it was \"Rain on Me\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1HY2Jd0NmPuamShAr6KMms\">Lady Gaga</a> -- before she launched her next album, Positions, with the release of its title track. The single reached number one just before the October 30 release of the album, which became her fifth to top the Billboard 200. \"34+35\" kept her planted toward the upper reaches of the singles chart, boosted by a 2021 remix with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5cj0lLjcoR7YOSnhnX0Po5\">Doja Cat</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a>. That same year, she teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> on a remix of his song \"Save Your Tears,\" delivering another chart-topper for both artists. They repeated this same success two years later when Grande appeared on a remix of \"Die for You\" from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>'s Starboy album.\r\n\nDuring this time, Grande had also pivoted back to acting, appearing in the 2021 ensemble satire Don't Look Up, for which she recorded \"Just Look Up\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>. She was also cast as Glinda in the film adaptation of Wicked, which began filming in 2022. In 2023, Grande celebrated a decade since her debut with the Yours Truly (Tenth Anniversary Edition) reissue. \r\n\nThe following year, she kicked off her next album cycle with the chart-topping, '90s-club-inspired \"yes, and?\" and a remix version featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>. The single paved the way for her seventh overall album, Eternal Sunshine, which arrived in March 2024. A conceptual journey through divorce and the sparks of new love, the set featured production by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a> and Ilya Salmanzadeh, and balanced upbeat empowerment with reflective vulnerability. The album, which also spawned the Hot 100 singles \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" topped the Billboard 200. It also picked up three Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi"

    "biography": "A powerhouse singer, songwriter, producer, and dancer, Beyoncé is a multifaceted global superstar by any measure. The Houstonian rose to fame in the late '90s as the central member of pop-R&B group <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>. The following decade, she started her ongoing streak of number one solo studio albums with Dangerously in Love (2003), the source of her first number one pop single, the ecstatic \"Crazy in Love.\" Nearly omnipresent hits such as the elegantly dismissive \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) and boisterous \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" (2008), combined with sold-out world tours and Grammy Awards, all heightened Beyoncé's profile in the 2000s. Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA acknowledged that, with 64 gold and platinum certifications, she was its top-selling artist. Beyoncé continued to diversify in the 2010s with the visual albums Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), followed by the <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> collaboration Everything Is Love (2018) and her work on the remake of The Lion King (2019). The latter project was expanded with the soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift, executive-produced by Beyoncé, who also wrote and directed the related musical film Black Is King (2020). Beyoncé has since become the most awarded artist in Grammy history with Renaissance (2022), a cosmopolitan dancefloor celebration tying together gospel, disco, house, bounce, and Afrobeats with nods to ballroom culture. The second act in that series, Cowboy Carter (2024), carried Beyoncé into the country music realm, topping the pop, country, and folk charts and winning Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Country Album, the first Black woman to achieve the latter.\r\n\nBorn in Houston, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles began performing at age seven, winning over 30 local competitions for her dancing and vocal abilities. She joined her cousin <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Kelly Rowland</a> and classmates LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett in forming an adolescent vocal group. Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé's father and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>'s legal guardian, signed on to be the girls' manager, eventually quitting his full-time job to focus on their efforts. This situation would ultimately lead to the creation of one of the most popular female R&B groups of all time: <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>.\r\n\n<a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a> gained momentum throughout the '90s. They appeared on Star Search in 1992 (under the name Girls Tyme) and weathered several lineup changes before signing to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Columbia+%22\">Columbia </a>in 1997. Four studio albums later, the group had officially become the best-selling female group of all time, with such smash hits as \"Jumpin' Jumpin',\" \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" \"Say My Name,\" and \"Survivor\" bolstering the young women's momentum despite lawsuits from former members Roberson and Luckett. In 2001, Beyoncé, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>, and replacement member <a href=\"spotify:artist:6t7nbFAc2dUa7oNu7kBOui\">Michelle Williams</a> allowed themselves a break from the group to pursue individual solo careers. Before landing several movie roles, Beyoncé became the first Black female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award. An appearance in the MTV drama Carmen: A Hip Hopera quickly followed, but it was her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in 2002's Austin Powers in Goldmember that established her as a true Hollywood star. \r\n\nWhile \"Work It Out,\" her inclusion on the movie's soundtrack failed to chart in the U.S., it was a Top Ten hit in the U.K. Beyoncé's full-length solo debut, 2003's Dangerously in Love, reached multi-platinum status. Featuring collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2wIVse2owClT7go1WT98tk\">Missy Elliott</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1G9G7WwrXka3Z1r7aIDjI7\">OutKast</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ht3wxeT69CzyKFChNnNAB\">Big Boi</a>, and romantic interest <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, the album spawned a total of four Top Ten singles and garnered the singer five Grammys. <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a> reconvened the following year to release Destiny Fulfilled; upon completing the resulting tour, the group issued one final album, a greatest-hits compilation entitled #1's, and subsequently disbanded. Beyoncé turned her full attention to her burgeoning solo career. She released B'day in September 2006 and, three months later, turned in an award-winning performance for the movie musical Dreamgirls. The singer then embarked on the Beyoncé Experience concert tour and released a live DVD in November 2007. \r\n\nThe following year proved to be another busy one as Beyoncé landed the role of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iOVhN3tnSvgDbcg25JoJb\">Etta James</a> in Cadillac Records, a musical biopic that explored the heyday of Chicago's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Chess%22\">Chess</a> label. Shooting commenced in February 2008, with Beyoncé also serving as co-executive producer. One month before the film's December release, the singer released her third studio album, I Am...Sasha Fierce. The double-disc effort emphasized her two distinct personalities, allowing Beyoncé to explore both mainstream sounds and traditional R&B. Some live releases followed. Released in 2009, I Am...Yours, a CD/DVD set, documented an August 2009 performance at Wynn Las Vegas, while 2010's I Am...World Tour, available in separate audio and video formats, was recorded at London's significantly larger O2 Arena (a few months after the Vegas program). She followed ten Grammy nominations with 2011's 4, which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. One of her most energetic and empowering tracks, \"Run the World (Girls),\" was issued as the lead single, while \"Love on Top\" eventually won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. \r\n\nGiving birth to Blue Ivy Carter in January 2012 didn't slow her down. Within a few months, she was performing in Atlantic City, and she later appeared at President <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FySKEW0F2fAmS8Jc5ClRv\">Barack Obama</a>'s second inauguration. Joined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6t7nbFAc2dUa7oNu7kBOui\">Michelle Williams</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Kelly Rowland</a>, she headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. Life Is But a Dream, a documentary, first aired on HBO in February 2013, and was followed by appearances on albums by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>. New material, such as \"Bow Down\" and \"Standing on the Sun,\" trickled out without proper releases. Then, on December 13 -- with no preceding announcement -- Beyoncé released a self-titled visual album (a full-length studio recording with an accompanying video for each song). Her husband and daughter, along with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Frank Ocean</a>, and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (via a sampled TED talk), made guest appearances. Beyoncé, assisted by the likes of Hit-Boy, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Y5TRrQiqgUO4S36tzjIRZ\">Timbaland</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a>, co-wrote and co-produced the majority of the album's material. Like Beyoncé's four previous solo albums, it went to number one, and quickly went platinum in the U.S. Three months after she completed the Mrs. Carter Show world tour, she and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> embarked on the On the Run Tour, which reached the U.S., Canada, and France from June through September 2014. The following February, she was nominated for six Grammy Awards and won three, including Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance, both for \"Drunk in Love.\" Although she didn't release any new material in 2015, she co-wrote and appeared on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1bT7m67vi78r2oqvxrP3X5\">Naughty Boy</a>'s Top Five U.K. pop hit \"Runnin' (Lose It All),\" and contributed vocals to <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\">Coldplay</a>'s \"Hymn for the Weekend.\" \r\n\nIn February 2016, a new single, \"Formation,\" and its trenchant accompanying video, were released just before her Super Bowl 50 half-time performance. That April, another striking visual album, Lemonade, premiered on HBO, and its audio was subsequently available for streaming and download. Some of the album's specific, forthright lyrics fueled speculation about the status of Beyoncé and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s relationship. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FZ3j1oH43e7cukCALsCwf\">Jack White</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> appeared as featured artists, while <a href=\"spotify:artist:2gpPCu8rjzdobGqDZJpHiR\">Just Blaze</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5TAipisjquAkq2o7lzMJyc\">Mike Dean</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX\">Diplo</a> were among the co-producers. The Formation World Tour began days later, just before the album became her sixth consecutive number one studio album. After wrapping that half-year trek, Coachella announced that Beyoncé would be headlining the festival's 2017 installment. While that performance was eventually canceled due to the birth of her twins, she would make a triumphant return to the desert stage a year later. Backed by a pyramid constructed with bleachers and over two-hundred backing performers, Beyoncé became the first Black female to headline the festival, closing both weekends of Coachella 2018 with historic performances that highlighted Black culture and featured guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2auiVi8sUZo17dLy1HwrTU\">Solange</a>, and a reunited <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>.\r\n\nMonths later in June 2018, while Beyoncé and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s co-headlining On the Run II tour was underway, the couple released Everything Is Love, a collaborative full-length credited to <a href=\"spotify:artist:4fpTMHe34LC5t3h5ztK8qu\">the Carters</a>. Led by \"Apeshit,\" a single featuring input from <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a>, the album narrowly missed the top spot on the Billboard 200. Wrapping at the end of the year, On the Run II was the third-highest grossing tour of 2018.\r\n\nTrue to form, Beyoncé issued a surprise live album, the Grammy-winning Homecoming, in April 2019. Paired with a film of the same title, the set documented her 2018 Coachella performance and added a cover of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DvdryKH4O95ZnsUZJKXpt\">Maze</a>'s \"Before I Let Go.\" Later that year, she not only starred as Nala in the photorealistic remake of The Lion King, but curated the film's accompanying soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift. Featuring a wealth of African artists collaborating with the likes of co-star <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tlzFDl81KD9RL045ewyIA\">Donald Glover</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4lPl9gqgox3JDiaJ1yklKh\">Tierra Whack</a>, the album also included her single \"Spirit,\" which went on to receive both Grammy and Oscar nominations. Beyoncé returned to the top of the Hot 100 in May 2020 as a featured artist on <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a>'s \"Savage Remix.\" Only two months later, she was behind the musical film Black Is King, also her third visual album. She took four awards from the subsequent Grammy ceremony: Best R&B Performance (for the Juneteenth charity single \"Black Parade\"), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (both for \"Savage\"), and Best Music Video (\"Brown Skin Girl\"). Another soundtrack song, \"Be Alive,\" arrived in May 2021 as part of the tennis biopic King Richard. \r\n\nIn June 2022, Beyoncé released \"Break My Soul,\" a house track made with \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" collaborators <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a> and Tricky Stewart, as the first single off her seventh studio album. The song reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100 before the late-July arrival of its parent release, Renaissance. A vibrant and uptempo collection inspired in part by post-'70s Black and queer dance music, Renaissance debuted at number one and in early 2023 earned Beyoncé four more Grammy Awards, making her the most awarded artist in the organization's history. Following the triumphant Renaissance World Tour, she released its accompanying documentary concert movie Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which she wrote, directed, and produced. A new track, \"My House,\" was released in conjunction.\r\n\nBeyoncé's next era was unveiled in February 2024 during Super Bowl LVIII in the form of singles such as the chart-topping \"Texas Hold 'Em\" -- the first number one on the country chart by a Black woman -- and the sweeping \"16 Carriages,\" from the country-tinged second act of her album trilogy, which she dubbed Cowboy Carter. The expansive 27-song set staked her claim in the genre with the help of guests such as veterans <a href=\"spotify:artist:32vWCbZh0xZ4o9gkz4PsEU\">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3\">Willie Nelson</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:78adFi9EyRkMh3CTIatrV9\">Linda Martell</a>, while the likes of Tanner Adell, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6YM5gRpMJkP0kUWRcvlHT3\">Brittney Spencer</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3y2cIKLjiOlp1Np37WiUdH\">Shaboozey</a> represented a younger generation of Black country artists. An intensely personal statement about reclamation, belonging, and legacy, Cowboy Carter entered the pop, country, and folk charts at number one. When the Grammy nominations were announced in late 2024, Beyoncé led the pack with 11 nominations, making her the most nominated artist in the show's history. At the 2025 ceremony, she finally took home Album of the Year while also making history as the first Black woman to win Best Country Album. Later that year, she launched the Cowboy Carter stadium tour. ~ TiVo Staff, Rovi"

    "biography": "Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake has retained a bigger-than-life commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or with a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca\">A$AP Rocky</a>. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning \"Hotline Bling\" and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>'s early work, starting the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22OVO+Sound%22\">OVO Sound</a> label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022's Honestly, Nevermind and 2023's For All the Dogs became cultural events. A heavily publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> in 2024 yielded a string of diss tracks, then Drake issued his third album made woith <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HPaUgqeutzr3jx5a9WyDV\">PartyNextDoor</a> titled $ome $exy $ongs 4 U.\r\n\nInitially known for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track, \"Replacement Girl\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:2iojnBLj0qIMiKPvVhLnsH\">Trey Songz</a>, was featured on BET's 106 & Park program as its \"Joint of the Day.\" He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry. It did not hurt that he had support from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>. \r\n\nBy the end of June 2009, \"Best I Ever Had,\" a promotional single, had climbed to number two on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After a fierce bidding war, Drake signed with Universal Motown in late summer and released an EP, So Far Gone, made up of songs from his popular mixtape of the same title. It peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and won a 2010 Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year. Thank Me Later, a full-length featuring collaborations with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:2qk9voo8llSGYcZ6xrBzKx\">Kings of Leon</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, was issued through <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Young+Money%22\">Young Money</a> in June 2010. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Still, the artist felt his debut was rushed, so its follow-up arrived in November 2011 with the title Take Care, referencing the increased time and effort put into the album's creation. Receiving critical acclaim, Grammy Awards, and the number one slot on the U.S. Billboard 200, Take Care cemented Drake's place as one of Canada's biggest exports. \r\n\nWhile on tour in 2012, Drake announced that he had started work on what would be his third studio album; Nothing Was the Same was released the following September. It spawned many singles, topped charts around the world, was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, and was nominated for a Best Rap Album Grammy Award. Soon after the album's release, Drake hit the road on an extended tour, took part in some collaborations, and released a few singles, including the Grammy-nominated \"0 to 100/The Catch Up.\" His next release was planned as a free mixtape before <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Cash+Money%22\">Cash Money</a> decided they would rather charge for it. The decidedly downbeat If You're Reading This It's Too Late was released in February 2015 and debuted at number one, while all 17 of its songs entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \r\n\nIn late summer 2015, Drake released a trio of new tracks on his SoundCloud page. One of them, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:7JLwBH0X2G8tgHceqvOu5B\">Timmy Thomas</a>-sampling \"Hotline Bling,\" became a Top Five pop hit in Canada and the U.S. and something of a cultural phenomenon. Later that year, Drake hit the studio with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> for a six-day session that yielded the mixtape What a Time to Be Alive. Upon the album's September release, it became Drake's second recording of the year to debut at number one. After issuing three singles in the beginning months of 2016, his fourth album, Views, arrived in April and debuted at number one. It revolved lyrically around his hometown of Toronto and featured production by longtime cohorts <a href=\"spotify:artist:4vQEj0zCIa6CvDruKZCLNk\">Noah \"40\" Shebib</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RQnTQM6OQd8dTUDF7UsT7\">Boi-1da</a>, among others. Late that year, Drake issued another trio of singles, including the chart-topping \"Fake Love.\" They preceded the playlist More Life, released the following March with appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>. The release became his seventh consecutive chart-topping album.\r\n\nAt the start of 2018, Drake issued the two-song EP Scary Hours. Both \"Diplomatic Immunity\" and \"God's Plan\" hit the Top Ten, the latter becoming his second solo chart-topper. It served as a precursor to his fifth album, the two-disc set Scorpion, which was broken into a rap side and an R&B side that featured the hit single \"Nice for What.\" It was released in June and instantly went platinum, while also breaking records for most streams in a single day. At the 61st Grammy Awards, Drake took home the prize for Best Rap Song for \"God's Plan.\" \r\n\nIn 2019, Drake raided the vaults for two archival releases: an official streaming release of the So Far Gone mixtape, and the Billboard 200-topping Care Package, which rounded up tracks that were leaked, discarded, or used as teasers, dating back to the Take Care era. Drake collected two Grammy nominations for the 2020 ceremonies, one for Best Rap Song with his <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a> collaboration \"Gold Roses\" and another for Best R&B Song with his <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>-assisted \"No Guidance.\" That same year, he released another mixtape made up of demos and singles titled Dark Lane Demo Tapes. One of the tracks was \"Toosie Slide,\" his third song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first male artist to accomplish that feat. \r\n\nDrake followed up with a slew of guest spots on songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2EMAnMvWE2eb56ToJVfCWs\">Bryson Tiller</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0p4ViyfJUTW0IT4SCBLexf\">Drakeo the Ruler</a>, then issued the \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" single in late 2020. The <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hcs9uc56yIGFCSy9leWe7\">Lil Durk</a>-featured track was touted as the first single from Certified Lover Boy, Drake's soon-to-be-released sixth official album. It didn't materialize as quickly as planned due to his knee surgery and recovery that precluded any work. Instead, an EP titled Scary Hours 2 was issued in early 2021, and Drake appeared on songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6loSmkIxQDRyetkJFNJHBr\">Smiley</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a>. Sporting a controversial Damien Hirst-designed cover, the trap-inspired CLB was finally released that September and featured appearances by a who's who of the rap scene past and present including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a>, and many more. Like the five previous records, it topped the album charts in Canada and the U.S. \r\n\nDrake stayed busy throughout 2022, appearing as a guest on albums by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, collaborating with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>, and signing a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Universal%22\">Universal</a> for one of the largest contracts in music business history. It took until June of that year for Drake to release any music under his own name, and when he did it was the house music-inspired Honestly, Nevermind. Though the album featured a large number of producers, most prominently <a href=\"spotify:artist:4vQEj0zCIa6CvDruKZCLNk\">Noah \"40\" Shebib</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6wMr4zKPrrR0UVz08WtUWc\">Black Coffee</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7CCjtD0hCK005Bvg2WG1a7\">Carnage</a>, the only other rapper to appear was <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>. The collaboration with the latter was built out into a full-length album titled Her Loss. Released in late 2022, the record relied on trap beats, melancholy synth washes, and a surprising number of disses. It topped both the Canadian Albums and Billboard 200 charts. In April 2023, he reached number two on the Hot 100 with \"Search & Rescue,\" a track that sampled Kim Kardashian. After branching out into poetry with his first book, Titles Ruin Everything, in July, Drake returned with his eighth album, For All the Dogs. It featured guests ranging from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a> to <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fGcIStdT1OpFFhOC7Wp36\">Teezo Touchdown</a>, and delivered a set of aggressive and melancholy trap songs. It was issued on October 6, the same day he announced a year-long sabbatical from music to focus on health issues. \r\n\nIn 2024, Drake became embroiled in a well-publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a>. After <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> had named the three as the \"big three\" greatest rappers in modern hip-hop, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> asserted that he was the only one during his guest verse on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s song \"Like That,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> then criticized <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> on his song \"7 Minute Drill,\" which was met with a poor reception; <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. In April, Drake released two diss tracks against <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>, \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" with the former reaching number ten on the Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> responded with the vitriolic \"Euphoria\" and a track posted to Instagram titled \"6:16 in L.A.\" Drake's \"Family Matters\" appeared in May, hitting number six on the Hot 100. It was promptly followed by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>'s Alchemist-produced \"Meet the Grahams\" and party-ready \"Not Like Us.\" Also that May, Drake responded with \"The Heart, Pt. 6,\" a reference to <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>'s ongoing \"The Heart\" song series. Later that year, he released the three song EP, 100 Gigs, which was rereleased after one of the song's had sample clearance issues. After a few months out of the spotlight, Drake teamed with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HPaUgqeutzr3jx5a9WyDV\">PartyNextDoor</a> for early 2025's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U. The album featured a familiar mix of trap and slow R&B, but also folded in elements of alternative rock, and notably, modern Mexican pop. ~ Tim Sendra, Rovi"

    "biography": "Inspired by Dua’s own self-discovery, Radical Optimism (out May 3) is the third album from 3x GRAMMY and 7x BRIT Award-winning pop powerhouse Dua Lipa. Radical Optimism taps into the pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face. The hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings that previously threatened to crush your soul, become milestones as you choose optimism and start to move with grace through the chaos. Rolling Stone has called the album “pop bliss,” while noting it is “uniquely and utterly Dua Lipa: confident dance pop full of witty Instagram-caption-ready one-liners.”\n\nRadical Optimism follows Dua&#39; sophomore album Future Nostalgia, which solidified her position as both a critical and commercial success. The GRAMMY-winning record was the longest running top 10 album by a female artist on the Billboard 200 in 2021 and spawned multiple worldwide hit singles, with “Levitating” earning certified diamond status and the title of Billboard’s No. 1 Hot 100 Song of 2021.\n\nDua’s eponymous 2017 debut album is certified platinum, spawned six platinum tracks, and made her the first female artist in BRIT Awards history to pick up five nominations in a single year. Dua has 10 GRAMMY nominations with three wins. Globally, she has amassed over 40 billion streams across platforms and has the top two most streamed albums by a female artist of all time on Spotify."

    "biography": "Idiosyncratic pop singer Ed Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path, molding genres to fit a musical character all his own that's charming, personable, and popular on a global scale. Elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits \"The A Team,\" \"Sing,\" \"Thinking Out Loud,\" and \"Shape of You\" -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut LP, +, and took 2014's x and 2017's ÷ to the top of both the U.K. albums chart and the Billboard 200. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including <a href=\"spotify:artist:6LuN9FCkKOj5PcnpouEgny\">Khalid</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4nDoRrQiYLoBzwC5BhVJzF\">Camila Cabello</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4YLtscXsxbVgi031ovDDdh\">Chris Stapleton</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0du5cEVh5yTK9QJze8zA0C\">Bruno Mars</a> -- and by continuing to write candidly about his life: his 2021 album = was filled with songs about being a new father. Sheeran's musical explorations continued on -, a 2023 album that featured several tracks co-written and co-produced by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Aaron Dessner</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB\">the National</a>, and its swiftly released companion, Autumn Variations, both of which reached the Top Five in the U.K. and on the Billboard 200.\r\n\nWhen Ed Sheeran released +, he had just turned 20. He had been playing music since he was a child in Framlingham, Suffolk -- he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire but his family moved when he was young -- enthralled by the classic rock he heard around the house. Sheeran started writing music in his early teens, recording a self-made album called Spinning Man when he was 13 in 2004. In addition to making music at home -- he put out an EP titled The Orange Room in 2005 -- he'd busk on the streets and play whatever stage he could find. When he was 16, he dropped out of school and moved to London so he could make a go of a professional career, landing work as a guitar tech for Nizlopi, gigging whenever he could, and auditioning unsuccessfully for the ITV series Britannia High. The self-released EP You Need Me arrived in 2009 -- it followed 2006's eponymous EP and 2007's Want Some? -- but his momentum started to build in 2010 thanks to the EPs Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy and, especially, performance videos he posted to YouTube. Sheeran started to generate considerable buzz -- <a href=\"spotify:artist:7LnaAXbDVIL75IVPnndf7w\">Jamie Foxx</a> invited him to appear on his Sirius/XM radio show -- and he landed a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Asylum+Records%22\">Asylum Records</a> in late 2010. After a final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations, arrived in January 2011, he signed a contract with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>'s management team.\r\n\nAll of this laid the groundwork for a busy 2011. Sheeran entered the studio with <a href=\"spotify:artist:20twLKFb2Nhd8duUH0k2DJ\">Jake Gosling</a> to record his major-label debut. Its first single, \"The A Team,\" arrived in June 2011, entering the charts at number three. August brought \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\" setting the stage for the September release of +. Assisted by the success of November's single \"Lego House,\" the record became a huge hit in the U.K., a fact underscored by his win of British Breakthrough in the 2012 Brit Awards. Sheeran's success soon spread to Australia, Europe, Canada, and then the United States. He received a boost in the U.S. by opening for <a href=\"spotify:artist:3rIZMv9rysU7JkLzEaC5Jp\">Snow Patrol</a> in 2012, but that paled in comparison to the exposure he received opening for <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Taylor Swift</a> on her Red tour in 2013. His endorsement from <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Swift</a>, combined with his landing of the closing credits song \"I See Fire\" for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, set Sheeran up for an eventful 2014.\r\n\nAlong with reuniting with <a href=\"spotify:artist:20twLKFb2Nhd8duUH0k2DJ\">Jake Gosling</a>, Sheeran worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1EpmQFTiJbcxzwbLpuUL8L\">Rick Rubin</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a> for X, the sophomore set that arrived in June 2014. X debuted at number one on both sides of the Atlantic and generated the huge hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Sing,\" success that helped Sheeran secure a win for Album of the Year in the 2015 Brit Awards, along with the trophy for Best Male Solo Artist. His success wasn't limited to Britain. X was the second biggest-selling album in the world in 2015, coming in behind <a href=\"spotify:artist:4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY\">Adele</a>'s 25, and \"Thinking Out Loud\" took home the Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.\r\n\nSheeran spent the majority of 2016 recuperating and recording his third album with executive producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>. Early in 2017, he released two singles, \"Castle on the Hill\" and \"Shape of You,\" with the latter reaching number one on the charts throughout the world. Their parent album, ÷, appeared in March. ÷ topped the pop charts in over 20 territories, including the U.K. and U.S., and it generated another international hit in \"Galway Girl.\" Ed Sheeran's massive popularity was confirmed in June 2017, when he was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the Queen's Birthday Honours. Over the next year, Sheeran stayed busy touring. He also picked up several more accolades including winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for ÷ and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You.\" \r\n\nIn 2019, he paired with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a> for the single \"I Don't Care.\" It was the first of a series of duets which Sheeran collected on No. 6 Collaborations Project. The album appeared on July 12, 2019 and topped numerous charts just a few weeks after the release of Yesterday, a Danny Boyle film set in an alternate world where <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a> never existed that featured Sheeran in a pivotal role. No. 6 Collaborations Project went on to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. In December 2020, Sheeran offered up the acoustic non-album single, \"Afterglow\" as a Christmas gift to his fans. \r\n\nSheeran returned with \"Bad Habits\" in June 2021; the single topped the charts in nearly every country, save the U.S., where it peaked at two. The track was the first single from his fifth album, =. Arriving in October 2021, the record found Sheeran grappling with fatherhood and featured songwriting collaborations from <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bUqnkrDrb4f7rqmDR9yDu\">Foy Vance</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bhMBjjQhgPX0q9S4Ajncn\">Ben Kweller</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:32opPqLCT3sF24Aso7wTXw\">Natalie Hemby</a>, among others. It continued Sheeran's streak of number one albums in the U.K. and was equally successful internationally. That December, he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a> for the holiday song \"Merry Christmas,\" which topped the U.K. singles chart and Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The single was also included on a Christmas edition of =, as well as <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">John</a>'s The Lockdown Sessions. Sheeran then collaborated with Colombian singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a> on 2021's \"Sigue\" and 2022's \"Forever My Love.\" Also in 2022, he scored a Top Ten U.K. hit with the Pokémon-related \"Celestial\" before kicking off 2023 with \"F64,\" a heartfelt tribute to the late British music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards. \r\n\nSheeran launched the cycle for his fifth album in early 2023 with the release of the singles \"Eyes Closed\" and \"Boat.\" Both songs were included on -, a record that featured several collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Aaron Dessner</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB\">the National</a>, along with work by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, Shellback, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bUqnkrDrb4f7rqmDR9yDu\">Foy Vance</a>. Four months afterward - debuted at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. Sheeran released Autumn Variations, an album recorded with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Dessner</a> as producer. The latter album also topped the charts in the U.K. and reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. By the end of the year, - had earned a Best Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 66th Grammy Awards. The singer's first-ever greatest-hits album, +-=÷× TOUR COLLECTION, arrived in September 2024 and combined live recordings  with some of his most beloved studio hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi"

    "biography": "Apart from being one of the best-selling artists in music history, Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of his generation. He's effortlessly fast, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides. And thanks to his mentor <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, he's had music to match with thick, muscular loops evoking the terror and paranoia conjured by his lyrics. To be certain, a great deal of the controversy Eminem courted came through in how his violent fantasias, often directed at his mother or his wife, intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas explored on his breakthrough albums The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem's commercial peak came around the time of his 2002 album The Eminem Show (which went platinum 27 times over) and with his crossover onto the big screen that same year with 8 Mile, a film that earned him acclaim for his performance and an Oscar for the film's anthem, \"Lose Yourself.\" Eminem's journey as a living rap legend included struggles with addiction, near-constant feuding with other artists, and a celebrity status that shifted as the years went on. Through all his various changes, however, he continued growing as an artist as well as consistently hitting high commercial marks. Though critics could be unkind to efforts like 2009's Relapse or 2017's Revival, fans made sure that each new album sold at least platinum numbers and topped the charts. Instead of recycling old ideas, the rapper experimented with new production approaches, faster flows, and increasingly complex multisyllabic wordplay on projects like 2020's Music to Be Murdered By and the 2024 concept album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), in which he confronted and killed his alter ego.\r\n\nBorn Marshall Mathers in the Kansas City, Missouri suburb of St. Joseph, Eminem spent his childhood between Missouri and Michigan, settling in Detroit in his teens. At the age of 14, he began rapping with a high school friend, the two adopting the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M,\" which soon morphed into Eminem. Under this name, Mathers entered battle rapping, a struggle dramatized in the fictionalized 8 Mile. Initially, the predominantly Black audience didn't embrace him, but soon his skills earned him a reputation, and he was recruited to join several rap groups. The first of these was the New Jacks, and after they disbanded, he joined Soul Intent, who released a single in 1995. This track also featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W7G3vXPeISR3Oi9ggVfyE\">Proof</a>, and the two rappers broke off on their own to form <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Qi4Bb7a8C0a00NZcA77L0\">D-12</a>, a six-member crew that functioned more as a <a href=\"spotify:artist:34EP7KEpOjXcM2TCat1ISk\">Wu-Tang</a>-styled collective than a regularly performing group. \r\n\nAs he was struggling to establish his career, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim had a daughter, Hailey, forcing him to spend less time rapping and more time providing for his family. He assembled his first album, Infinite, which received some underground attention in 1996, not all of it positive. After its release, Eminem developed his Slim Shady alter ego, a persona that freed him to dig deep into his dark id, something he needed as he faced a number of personal upheavals, beginning with a bad split with Kim, which led him to move in with his mother and increase his use of drugs and alcohol, capped off by an unsuccessful suicide attempt. All this sturm und drang was channeled into The Slim Shady EP, which is where he first demonstrated many of the quirks that became his trademark, including his twitchy, nasal rhyming and disturbingly violent imagery. \r\n\nThe Slim Shady EP opened many doors, the most notable being a contract with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope+Records%22\">Interscope Records</a>. After Eminem came in second at the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle in Los Angeles, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a> head Jimmy Iovine sought him out, giving the EP to <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, who proved eager to work with Eminem. They quickly cut Em's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a> debut in the fall of 1998 -- during which time Marshall reconciled with Kim and married her -- and The Slim Shady LP appeared early in 1999, preceded by the single \"My Name Is.\" Both were instant blockbusters and Eminem became a lightning rod for attention, earning praise and disdain for his violent, satirical fantasias. \r\n\nHe quickly followed The Slim Shady LP with The Marshall Mathers LP in the summer of 2000. By this point, there was little doubt that Eminem was one of the biggest stars in pop music: the album sold almost two million copies within the first two weeks of release, but Mathers felt compelled to tweak other celebrities, provoking pop stars in his lyrics, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4xtWjIlVuZwTCeqVAsgEXy\">Insane Clown Posse</a>'s entourage in person, providing endless fodder for the tabloids. This gossip blended with growing criticism about his violent and homophobic lyrics, and under this fire, he reunited his old crew, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Qi4Bb7a8C0a00NZcA77L0\">D-12</a>, releasing an album in 2001, then touring with the group.\r\n\nDuring this furor, he had his biggest hit in the form of the moody ballad \"Stan.\" Performed at the Grammys as a duet with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>, thereby undercutting some accusations of homophobia, the song helped Eminem cross over to a middlebrow audience, setting the stage for the ultimate crossover of 2001's 8 Mile. Directed by Curtis Hanson, best known as the Oscar-nominated director of L.A. Confidential, the gritty drama fictionalized Eminem's pre-fame Detroit days and earned considerable praise, culminating in one of his biggest hits with the theme \"Lose Yourself,\" which won Mathers an Oscar. \r\n\nAfter all this, he retreated from the spotlight to record his third album, The Eminem Show. Preceded by the single \"Without Me,\" it turned into another huge hit, albeit not quite as strong as its predecessor, and there were some criticisms suggesting that Eminem wasn't expanding his horizons much. Encore, released late in 2004, did reach into more mature territory, notably on the anti-<a href=\"spotify:artist:2JZbcOAw67koOHlFTjMeGX\">George W. Bush</a> \"Mosh,\" but most of the controversy generated by the album was for behind-the-scenes events: a bus crash followed by canceled dates and a stint in rehab. Rumors of retirement flew, and the 2005 appearance of Curtain Call: The Hits did nothing to dampen them, nor did the turmoil of 2006, a year that saw Mathers remarrying and divorcing Kim within a matter of four months, as well as the shooting death of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W7G3vXPeISR3Oi9ggVfyE\">Proof</a> at a Detroit club.\r\n\nDuring all this, Em did some minor studio work, but he soon dropped off the radar completely, retreating to his Detroit home. He popped up here and there, most notably debuting the hip-hop channel Shade 45 for Sirius Satellite Radio in September 2008, but it wasn't until early 2009 that he mounted a comeback with Relapse, an album whose very title alluded to some of Mathers' struggles with prescription drugs, but it also announced that after an extended absence, Slim Shady was back. While not quite a blockbuster, the album went platinum, and Eminem followed it at the end of the year with an expanded version of Relapse (dubbed Relapse: Refill) that added outtakes and new recordings. Recovery, initially titled Relapse 2, was issued in June 2010. The album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 chart, where it remained for five consecutive weeks, while its leadoff single, \"Not Afraid,\" debuted on top of the magazine's Hot 100 singles chart.\r\n\nThe year 2010 also brought Eminem back together with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DVipHzYsPlIoA0DW8Gmns\">Royce da 5'9\"</a> under the <a href=\"spotify:artist:77IURH5NC56Jn09QHi76is\">Bad Meets Evil</a> moniker. In turn, June 2011's Hell: The Sequel marked the release of their first EP as a duo (barring the previous month's release of key EP track \"Fastlane\" as a single) and was their first batch of new material since a 1999 double A-side. After an intense period of recording, Eminem announced in August 2013 that his next solo album would be a nostalgically themed set of new material entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2, which landed in early November. The album featured the singles \"Berzerk,\" \"Rap God,\" and \"Survival,\" plus the chart-topping hit \"The Monster\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>. In 2014, new tracks landed on the double-disc set Shady XV, which celebrated the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Shady%22\">Shady</a> label's 15th birthday. The singles \"Phenomenal\" and \"Kings Never Die\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4yiQZ8tQPux8cPriYMWUFP\">Gwen Stefani</a> arrived a year later, both taken from the Southpaw soundtrack. \r\n\nEminem resurfaced in October 2017 with a freestyle anti-Trump rap, which didn't appear on Revival, the December 2017 album that was filled with cameos, including appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a> (\"Walk on Water\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a> (\"River\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1KCSPY1glIKqW2TotWuXOR\">P!nk</a> (\"Need Me\"). His seventh straight chart-topper, it ultimately failed to match the sales heights of past efforts, despite the international success of the \"River\" single. The next year, without warning, Eminem issued his surprise tenth album, Kamikaze. The set featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6C1ohJrd5VydigQtaGy5Wa\">Joyner Lucas</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DVipHzYsPlIoA0DW8Gmns\">Royce da 5'9\"</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3KedxarmBCyFBevnqQHy3P\">Jessie Reyez</a>, as well as \"Venom,\" from the film of the same name. In January 2020, he repeated this surprise-release approach with 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By. The album featured production from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a> and cameos from the now-usual host of special guests, this time featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ZotbHeyVQKxQCPDJuQ4SU\">Q-Tip</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3jK9MiCrA42lLAdMGUZpwa\">Anderson .Paak</a>, and the late <a href=\"spotify:artist:4MCBfE4596Uoi2O4DtmEMz\">Juice Wrld</a>, among many others. The set debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and was re-released in expanded form in December under the title Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. In 2021, Eminem appeared on the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utLUGcTvOJFr6aqIJtYWV\">Skylar Grey</a> song \"Last One Standing\" along with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6AgTAQt8XS6jRWi4sX7w49\">Polo G</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4AA474G2hRfrHyGrfyDseO\">Mozzy</a>. The track was featured on the soundtrack for the film Venom: Let There Be Carnage and cracked the Top 100 of the Billboard charts. 2021 also saw Eminem opening a spaghetti restaurant in Detroit, named Mom's Spaghetti after a line from \"Lose Yourself.\" \r\n\nIn February 2022, he performed alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and others at the half-time show of Super Bowl LVI. That June, Eminem released \"The King and I,\" a track he recorded with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5nLYd9ST4Cnwy6NHaCxbj8\">CeeLo Green</a> for the soundtrack of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7HhTERkBV4Ot14KphgBfSh\">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\">Elvis Presley</a> biopic, Elvis. \"The King and I\" was one of three new songs on Curtain Call 2, a 2022 compilation covering the singles Eminem had released since Curtain Call: The Hits. \"From the D to the LBC,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, was also featured on Curtain Call 2. \r\n\nIn June of 2024, Eminem released his 12th studio LP The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce). The album largely centered around the concept of Marshall Mathers being kidnapped by his alter ego Slim Shady and fighting internally between these two sides of his personality. The album included production work from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6GEykX11lQqp92UVOQQCC7\">DJ Premier</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>, as well as rap cameos from <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0sKsReKseslDlhxmbN6wLk\">BabyTron</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6U3ybJ9UHNKEdsH7ktGBZ7\">JID</a>, and others. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi"

    "biography": "Chart-topping and influential rapper Future is known for a uniquely fluid and melodic yet mumbling vocal style. He busted out of the South at the dawn of the 2010s with a flurry of mixtapes, high-charting albums, certified platinum singles, and contributions to several other hits as a featured artist, then continued to hover at the top of his game, both commercially and creatively, in the years that followed. After he scored his first hit via a guest spot on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utmqQVLD5gB15ezM0mYuI\">YC</a>'s \"Racks\" (2011), Future quickly became a key factor in Atlanta's grip on the Billboard charts, often with production support from fellow ATL natives and dwellers such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NWbwDZY1VkRqFafuQm6wk\">Mike WiLL Made-It</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:655963AgkTZeYUvCyodCIL\">Sonny Digital</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:23DYJsw4uSCguIqiTIDtcN\">Southside</a>. By the end of 2017, Future had amassed 32 Top Ten R&B/hip-hop hits as a headliner and featured artist. Meanwhile, 11 full-length projects -- including an all-platinum run of DS2 (2015), Evol (2016), and Future (2017) -- debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200. Future capped off the 2010s by adding to his Top 20 tally with the Grammy-winning \"King's Dead,\" co-producing a remake of Super Fly, and hitting the top of the Billboard 200 again with The Wizrd (2019). He has since returned to the throne with several projects, including High Off Life (2020), WE DON'T TRUST YOU/WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, 2024), and Mixtape Pluto (2024).\r\n\nBorn <a href=\"spotify:artist:36rXTEX3RKUx0gsSflnFHd\">Nayvadius Wilburn</a>, Future grew up in his city's Zone 6 section with roots in the ATL's <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ElKnrmCBRnIjTrrzkAL42\">Dungeon Family</a>, who dubbed him \"the Future.\" Mentored by cousin and fellow <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ElKnrmCBRnIjTrrzkAL42\">Dungeon Family</a> member Rico Wade of the revered <a href=\"spotify:artist:7qvIiE9YmyP02NLjufTxkX\">Organized Noize</a>, Future released his first mixtapes in 2010 and early 2011, which left him poised for a mainstream breakthrough. A few months after the January 2011 release of his third mixtape, Future was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utmqQVLD5gB15ezM0mYuI\">YC</a>'s \"Racks,\" a single that bubbled up to the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Shortly thereafter, the rapper signed with major label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Epic%22\">Epic</a>, and \"Tony Montana,\" his proper debut single, subsequently peaked just outside the Top 20. Its parent album, Pluto, landed the following April and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, supported by the number two R&B/hip-hop hit \"Turn on the Lights,\" which earned Future his first RIAA platinum certification. No new studio albums were released in 2013, but Future's year was productive as a guest artist. He appeared on four Top Ten R&B/hip-hop hits that went either gold or platinum: <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>'s \"Love Me,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:31HjiqargV4NAw4GZqUale\">Ace Hood</a>'s \"Bugatti,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:6h2J3dxLnTyURwIUBumKog\">Rich Gang</a>'s \"Tapout,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0T5OJgMVjKIX3b3W3ekqOl\">Rocko</a>'s \"U.O.E.N.O.\" He also appeared on a remix of \"Body Party\" by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2NdeV5rLm47xAvogXrYhJX\">Ciara</a>, who became his fiancée that October. \r\n\nFuture's second full-length album, Honest, was issued in April 2014. It earned both critical acclaim and popular success and peaked at number two. Two singles from the album, \"Move That Dope\" (featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XvaV0jFnwEthusiVdEBHK\">Casino</a>) and \"I Won\" (co-produced by frequent collaborator <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a> and featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>), went gold. A few months after the album's release, Future and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2NdeV5rLm47xAvogXrYhJX\">Ciara</a>'s split was made public. Late 2014 and early 2015 brought three mixtapes and another hit single, \"Fuck Up Some Commas.\" They primed Future fans for third album DS2, which debuted at number one in July 2015. Only two months later, What a Time to Be Alive, a mixtape collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, reached the same spot.\r\n\nIn early 2016, Future released Evol, which arrived unannounced but still debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Its single \"Low Life,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>, quickly went double platinum. In November of that year, Future issued another <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>-assisted hit, \"Used to This,\" from his Beast Mode 16 mixtape. The roll continued through 2017 with a pair of full-lengths, Future and HNDRXX. Issued during consecutive weeks that February, the two albums kept Future's streak of number ones intact, while the former, featuring the Top Ten pop hit \"Mask Off,\" became the rapper's third consecutive platinum solo full-length. Later that year, he hopped onto <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>'s \"Don't Judge Me\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1zNqQNIdeOUZHb8zbZRFMX\">Swae Lee</a> before issuing Super Slimey, a joint effort with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>.\r\n\nFuture followed with a pair of soundtrack contributions in 2018. First, he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a> for a hit single from the Black Panther soundtrack, \"King's Dead,\" and a few months later released \"No Shame\" from Superfly. He not only contributed to the soundtrack but presented it as well, and was among the film's co-producers. Future started 2019 with the release of his seventh album, The Wizrd, which became his fifth solo chart-topper (and sixth overall). The set featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a>, while <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a> assisted \"First Off,\" one of its three charting singles. Less than a month after the release of that album, Future won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance for his contribution to \"King's Dead.\" He returned later in 2019 with the darker and more pained Save Me, a seven-track EP that reached number five.\r\n\nFuture got an early start on the new decade in January 2020 with \"Life Is Good,\" another <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> collaboration. The single became his second Top Ten pop hit as a headliner and reached quadruple-platinum status by the time he issued High Off Life in May. Originally intended to be titled after the preceding hit -- Future opted to go with a less contentious title due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- High Off Life entered the Billboard 200 at number one. Among its follow-up singles were \"Tycoon\" and \"Trillionaire,\" the latter featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7wlFDEWiM5OoIAt8RSli8b\">YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a>. Before the year was over, Future teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> for the collaborative album Pluto x Baby Pluto. The record was released in November 2020 and debuted at number two on the Billboard chart. \r\n\nFuture remained relatively quiet in 2021, but he returned in 2022 for his ninth solo LP, I NEVER LIKED YOU, which once again topped the U.S. charts. WE DON'T TRUST YOU, Future's first album co-billed with longtime producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, appeared in 2024, and was another chart-topping success. Three weeks after it was released, it was followed by WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU, a distinct album and not a deluxe edition of the first collaboration. Once again, it reached number one. The feature-free Mixtape Pluto became Future's third chart-topping release of 2024. ~ David Jeffries & Andy Kellman, Rovi"

Filling stadiums, crafting cloud-rattling anthems, &amp; breaking records at every turn, diamond-certified GRAMMY Award-winning band Imagine Dragons occupy rarified air as one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Tallying cumulative sales of 74M&#43; album equivalents, 65M&#43; digital songs, &amp; over 160 billion streams, they stand out as “the only band in history to earn four RIAA Diamond singles. Since emerging in 2009, they’ve scored five consecutive Top 10 debuts on the Billboard Top 200 with Night Visions [2012] (7x-platinum), Smoke&#43;Mirrors [2015] (platinum), Evolve [2017] (triple-platinum), Origins [2018] (platinum), &amp; Mercury – Act 1 [2021] (platinum). Dominating radio, they remain one of only four bands to achieve consecutive Top 5 singles at Alternative radio, &amp; the only band to repeat this feat. The band holds the crown for the group with most billion-plus streamed songs on Spotify, becoming the first in the platform’s history to have ten songs reach this milestone. They’ve collaborated with everyone from Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, Avicii &amp; film composer Hans Zimmer. Giving back, they’ve raised millions for various causes, including their pediatric cancer charity (Tyler Robinson Foundation), &amp; frontman Dan Reynolds&#39; LOVELOUD Foundation &amp; festival in support of LGBTQ&#43; youth. In 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky named them ambassadors for UNITED 24, which benefits humanitarian aid in Ukraine"

    "biography": "One of the most influential, critically lauded, and controversial artists of the early 21st century, American rapper and producer Kanye West has gone from hip-hop beatmaker to worldwide hitmaker with a wildly successful solo career that counted an unbroken string of chart-topping, multi-platinum albums and nearly two-dozen Grammy Awards. His early-2000s production work quickly led to a major-label recording contract, yielding a classic trilogy comprised of 2004's The College Dropout, 2005's Late Registration, and 2007's Graduation. With each successive album, he pushed the boundaries of hip-hop and soon entered a new phase of artistry with game changers such as 2008's 808s & Heartbreak, 2010's widely regarded magnum opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and 2013's industrial-leaning foray Yeezus. Celebrity, tabloid headlines, and a changing artistic vision informed much of his next era, as the trappings of fame and inner turmoil became the focus of chart-toppers such as The Life of Pablo and Ye. He even released a gospel album, Jesus Is King, in 2019. As his outspoken personality and political statements began to eclipse his music into the 2020s, he still managed to top the charts and garner accolades with 2020's exploratory Donda. In 2023, West joined forces with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a> to form a new project, ¥$ and quickly releasing chapters of a trilogy in 2024 that included the albums Vultures 1 and Vultures 2.\r\n\nA proud and vocal Chicagoan, West was actually born in Atlanta, moving to the Windy City with his English professor mother after his parents split when he was three years old. One of his major inspirations, Donda West helped shape young Kanye, taking him to China in the late '80s on education exchange and establishing a strong base that made him a top pupil in high school. However, his music dreams would eventually eclipse academics and he dropped out of college, setting the stage for his best-selling school trilogy. With guidance from local producer No I.D., West went on to learn the finer points of studio production, programming, and sampling, the latter technique becoming a hallmark of his early work. \r\n\nHe first got his foot in the industry door in the late '90s, doing quite a bit of noteworthy production work for the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6nfYGe7IIuuP5bMY1jkJP6\">Jermaine Dupri</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1wvlC6NwleHt1iRD6d5X2C\">Foxy Brown</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1wiBLzTI7z9RUwEpNPdFT6\">Mase</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3F2Y683ovlWT53WKCeq0oj\">Goodie Mob</a>. However, it was West's work for the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Roc-A-Fella%22\">Roc-A-Fella</a> label at the dawn of the new millennium that took his career to the next level. Alongside fellow fresh talent <a href=\"spotify:artist:2gpPCu8rjzdobGqDZJpHiR\">Just Blaze</a>, West became one of the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Roc%22\">Roc</a>'s go-to producers, consistently delivering hot tracks to album after album. His star turn came on <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s classic The Blueprint (2001) with album standouts \"Takeover\" and \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.).\" Both songs showcased West's signature beatmaking style at the time, which was largely sample-based; in these cases, the former track appropriated snippets of <a href=\"spotify:artist:22WZ7M8sxp5THdruNY3gXt\">the Doors</a>' \"Five to One,\" while the latter sampled <a href=\"spotify:artist:2iE18Oxc8YSumAU232n4rW\">the Jackson 5</a>'s \"I Want You Back.\" \r\n\nMore high-profile productions followed, and before long, word spread that West was going to release an album of his own, on which he planned to rap as well as produce. Unfortunately, that effort was a long time coming, pushed back repeatedly until a car crash in 2002 threatened to end his solo career before it even started. The accident left him with a jaw wired shut during his weeks-long recovery. He capitalized on the traumatic experience by using it as the inspiration for \"Through the Wire\" (and its corresponding video), which would later become the lead single for his debut album, 2004's The College Dropout. As the album was further delayed, West continued to create big hits for the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0lEssBAxQl2In4RpaB1C2Y\">Talib Kweli</a> (\"Get By\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ipn9JLAPI5GUEo4y4jcoi\">Ludacris</a> (\"Stand Up\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> (\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DiDSECUqqY1AuBP8qtaIa\">Alicia Keys</a> (\"You Don't Know My Name\"). Then, just as \"Through the Wire\" was breaking big-time at the tail-end of 2003, another West song caught fire, a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vbY3hOaCAhC7VjucswgdS\">Twista</a> and actor <a href=\"spotify:artist:7LnaAXbDVIL75IVPnndf7w\">Jamie Foxx</a> called \"Slow Jamz,\" which gave the rapper/producer two simultaneously ubiquitous singles and a much-anticipated debut album. As with so many of West's songs, the singles were driven by somewhat recognizable sample-based hooks: <a href=\"spotify:artist:6mQfAAqZGBzIfrmlZCeaYT\">Chaka Khan</a>'s \"Through the Fire\" in the case of \"Through the Wire\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:19y5MFBH7gohEdGwKM7QsP\">Luther Vandross</a>' \"A House Is Not a Home\" in the case of \"Slow Jamz.\" During these early days, West paired his beats with tongue-twisting raps and outspoken confidence. With a backpack and brightly colored polo shirt, his dapper fashion sense set him apart from many of his peers, while his attitude often came across as boastful and egotistical. This flamboyance made for good press, something that West enjoyed, for better or worse, throughout the course of his career. \r\n\nIn the wake of his breakout success, West earned a whopping ten nominations at the 47th annual Grammy Awards in early 2005. The College Dropout won the Best Rap Album award, \"Jesus Walks\" won Best Rap Song, and a songwriting credit on \"You Don't Know My Name\" for Best R&B Song award was shared with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DiDSECUqqY1AuBP8qtaIa\">Alicia Keys</a> and Harold Lilly. Later that year, West released his second solo album, Late Registration, which spawned a series of hit singles (\"Diamonds in Sierra Leone,\" \"Gold Digger,\" \"Heard 'Em Say,\" \"Touch the Sky\"). The album topped the charts, as did the \"Gold Digger\" single, and Late Registration eventually won a Grammy for Rap Album of the Year. West's production work continued more or less unabated during this time; particularly noteworthy were hits for <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vbY3hOaCAhC7VjucswgdS\">Twista</a> (\"Overnight Celebrity\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:4qwGe91Bz9K2T8jXTZ815W\">Janet Jackson</a> (\"I Want You\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:05oH07COxkXKIMt6mIPRee\">Brandy</a> (\"Talk About Our Love\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NbfKEOTQCcwd6o7wSDOHI\">the Game</a> (\"Dreams\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:2GHclqNVjqGuiE5mA7BEoc\">Common</a> (\"Go!\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vfezMIyCr4XUdYRaKIKi3\">Keyshia Cole</a> (\"I Changed My Mind\"). West also founded his own label, GOOD Music (\"Getting Out Our Dreams\"), in conjunction with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Sony+BMG%22\">Sony BMG</a>. The label's inaugural release was <a href=\"spotify:artist:5y2Xq6xcjJb2jVM54GHK3t\">John Legend</a>'s Get Lifted (2004), followed one year later by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2GHclqNVjqGuiE5mA7BEoc\">Common</a>'s Be. In addition to all of his studio work, West also toured internationally in support of Late Registration and released Late Orchestration: Live at Abbey Road Studios (2006) in commemoration.\r\n\nAfter retreating from the spotlight for some time, West returned to the forefront of the music world in 2007 with a series of album releases. <a href=\"spotify:artist:5KkgZ31b9eDwkvo9oMIrSm\">Consequence</a>'s Don't Quit Your Day Job and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2GHclqNVjqGuiE5mA7BEoc\">Common</a>'s Finding Forever, both released by GOOD, were chiefly produced by West; the latter proved to be particularly popular, topping the album chart upon its release in July. And then there was West's third solo album, Graduation, which was promoted well in advance of its September 11 release (a memorable date that pitted Kanye against <a href=\"spotify:artist:3q7HBObVc0L8jNeTe5Gofh\">50 Cent</a>, who in one interview swore he would quit music if his own album, Curtis, wasn't the top-seller). A pair of singles -- \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" and \"Stronger,\" the latter an interpolation of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi\">Daft Punk</a>'s 2001 single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" -- led the promotional push. It became his third consecutive chart-topping album, and its success culminated in eight Grammy nominations. West was the victor in four of the categories, and he performed two songs during the ceremony, including Late Registration's \"Hey Mama,\" chosen in honor of his recently deceased mother. That loss, compounded by a breakup with his fiancée, informed 2008's genre-busting landmark 808s & Heartbreak, a major change of pace that saw West singing most of his emotionally pained lyrics with the assistance of Auto-Tune. The album went platinum, spawning Top Three hits \"Love Lockdown\" and \"Heartless,\" while influencing a generation of young rappers wanting to tap into their emotional sides. West toured internationally, even returning to China in 2008 for a stop on his Glow in the Dark Tour. However, after a headline-grabbing turn at the 2009 MTV Video Awards involving <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Taylor Swift</a>, West retreated from the spotlight to record another album.\r\n\nIn 2010, West emerged with his fifth work, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which marked the start of a new era for the artist, one focused on fame, sex, and opulent production. Recorded in Hawaii, the star-studded set recruited a staggering number of guest vocal spots from the likes of  <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ\">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iCwCMnqsNZ6atvRiADgtn\">RZA</a>. Preceded by the bombastic, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7M1FPw29m5FbicYzS2xdpi\">King Crimson</a>-sampling single \"Power,\" Fantasy also included the Grammy-winning \"All of the Lights,\" fan favorite \"Runaway,\" and \"Monster,\" which featured a star-making turn by a young <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>. A sprawling and audacious statement, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, won a Grammy for Best Rap Album, and also went multi-platinum. While the album was still hot, West recorded the aggressive and boast-heavy Watch the Throne with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> and numerous producers and songwriters. Billed as a set by the Throne, it was released in August 2011 and entered the Billboard Top 200 chart at number one. A trio of hit singles -- \"Otis,\" \"No Church in the Wild,\" and \"Ni**as in Paris\" -- climbed the charts and each won Grammy Awards, capping a dominant run for the rapper that resulted in 21 Grammys within just eight years.\r\n\nIn September 2012, he released the GOOD Music collaboration album Cruel Summer, which featured artists such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:10OkdvLhRAzHz5MpVUntXp\">Lifted</a>. Four singles (\"Mercy,\" \"Cold,\" \"New Flow,\" and \"Clique\") were released as promotion for the record. Toward the end of the year, there were rumblings from acclaimed producers that a new album would emerge soon. These murmurs were soon confirmed when West himself announced that he was working on his sixth album with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi\">Daft Punk</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Jpl66cKT71NZffeBo2LNx\">King L.</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:13rHmjtJmlIJ2aDyJc7CLV\">Justin Vernon</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1EpmQFTiJbcxzwbLpuUL8L\">Rick Rubin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:15iVAtD3s3FsQR4w1v6M0P\">Chief Keef</a>, and many more contributing. As one of the most eagerly anticipated albums of 2013, the angry and aggressive Yeezus was released to rapturous reviews from critics. Incorporating industrial-electronic touches, screamed vocals, and soaring gospel, West touched upon both controversial and sensitive topics while delivering an astonishing and bold record, described as his most confrontational and bravest album to date. Despite leaking days before its official release, Yeezus still sold almost 327,000 copies during its first week and singles \"Black Skinhead\" and \"Bound 2\" were certified platinum while \"New Slaves\" received a Grammy nomination.\r\n\nThe year 2013 also proved to be a personal milestone for West, as he became a father for the first time with partner Kim Kardashian. The following year, he announced a new album and released \"Only One\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4STHEaNw4mPZ2tzheohgXB\">Paul McCartney</a>, which, like his 2015 single \"FourFiveSeconds\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4STHEaNw4mPZ2tzheohgXB\">McCartney</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>, remained a non-LP release. Later, he announced another, different album, titled So Help Me God, which later turned to SWISH, then Waves, and finally The Life of Pablo. The album was released on Valentine's Day 2016 and shot to the top of the Billboard 200. The guest list for the platinum-selling effort included <a href=\"spotify:artist:1anyVhU62p31KFi8MEzkbf\">Chance the Rapper</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5WUlDfRSoLAfcVSX1WnrxN\">Sia</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vXTefBL93Dj5IqAWq6OTv\">French Montana</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:246dkjvS1zLTtiykXe5h60\">Post Malone</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, and many more. In the age of streaming and direct artist-to-fan access, West took advantage of the technology and continued to tinker with the album even after it was released, tweaking production, guest verses, and even lyrics.\r\n\nDuring the promotion of Pablo, West canceled the final dates of his revolutionary Saint Pablo Tour -- during which he performed from a \"floating\" stage suspended above the pit -- and was hospitalized for psychiatric observation. He retreated from the spotlight for nearly a year and re-emerged in 2017 to begin recording material for his next album -- as well as production for artists on his GOOD Music label -- at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While there, he also continued to court controversy with his political views and public statements made via social media. Amidst the headline flurry, he released a pair of singles in April 2018: \"Lift Yourself\" and \"Ye vs. the People\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a> The following month, West delivered the first of the \"Wyoming Sessions\" studio productions with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>'s critically acclaimed, Grammy-nominated Daytona. A week later, West released his eighth official set, Ye, which featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, as well as production by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5TAipisjquAkq2o7lzMJyc\">Mike Dean</a>, Che Pope, <a href=\"spotify:artist:23EA28263XvtIrXuySX6oI\">Francis and the Lights</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>. Singles \"Yikes\" and \"All Mine\" were both certified platinum and hovered around the Top Ten on the Hot 100. The third installment of the series arrived the next week, marking the debut of the collaborative project <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hPgGN4uhvXAxiXQBIXOmE\">Kids See Ghosts</a>, a duo formed by West and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Cudi</a>. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hPgGN4uhvXAxiXQBIXOmE\">Kids See Ghosts</a> featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Mz5XE0kb1GBnbLQm2VbcO\">Mos Def</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>, as well as samples of <a href=\"spotify:artist:52lBOxCxbJg0ttXEW9CQpW\">Louis Prima</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6pAuTi6FXi6qFQJ1dzMXQs\">Kurt Cobain</a>. West's Wyoming Sessions were completed with the release of <a href=\"spotify:artist:20qISvAhX20dpIbOOzGK3q\">Nas</a>' Nasir and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ULO7IGI3M2bo0Ap7B9h8a\">Teyana Taylor</a>'s K.T.S.E., and he received a nomination for Producer of the Year at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\r\n\nFollowing the flurry of activity in Wyoming, West released a pair of singles to close out the year. While the drug- and lust-filled \"XTCY\" was more of a B-side, its follow-up \"I Love It\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3wyVrVrFCkukjdVIdirGVY\">Lil Pump</a> took off on the charts and became a viral hit, boosted by a surreal music video and equally quirky live television performances. Certified double platinum, the song was West's highest charting on the Hot 100 since 2015's \"FourFiveSeconds.\" Riding the momentum of \"I Love It,\" West announced that another album was imminent. Like the pre-Pablo SWISH and Waves buildup, the proposed Yandhi -- a sequel to Yeezus -- never materialized and, in 2019, West revealed the album would be titled Jesus Is King. To promote the effort, he expanded his \"Sunday Service\" gospel revival events across the U.S., playing early versions of the album to fans in Detroit, Chicago, and New York City. Issued that October, Jesus Is King became West's ninth straight number one studio album as a headliner. Singles \"Closed on Sunday\" and \"Follow God\" landed the rapper on multiple international charts, while the latter was certified gold in the U.S. A companion set from West's <a href=\"spotify:artist:2c9O21YLFy4tFI9zCVhbFg\">Sunday Service Choir</a>, Jesus Is Born, arrived on Christmas Day 2019. Although West's vocals did not appear on the album, the crew intertwined their takes on tracks like \"Ultralight Beam\" and \"Father Stretch My Hands\" with their versions of beloved gospel songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6VUdDU44uo3KwSHc9lAEFE\">the Clark Sisters</a> and Reverend Timothy Wright.\r\n\nRecording for West's tenth album, Donda, began in early 2020. Named after his late mother, the release of Donda was surrounded by the same chaotic energy that encircled everything West was involved with at the time. Release dates were announced and pushed back, and after a listening party at Atlanta's Mercedes Benz Stadium in late July of 2021, West took up residence in one of the stadium's locker rooms to continue mixing and finalizing the recording of the album. Another listening party was scheduled around a new, tentative release date. The Grammy-nominated set finally arrived in August and entered number one in over a dozen countries. A sequel, Donda 2, appeared in February of 2022, exclusively available as part of the Stem Player, a remix device and streaming platform developed by British company Kano Computing in collaboration with West. However, because the release was not made available to purchase or stream outside of the device, it was deemed ineligible for the Billboard charts. Featuring the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Baby Keem</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2LIk90788K0zvyj2JJVwkJ\">Jack Harlow</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DiDSECUqqY1AuBP8qtaIa\">Alicia Keys</a>, and many more, it reportedly managed to sell thousands of players, earning West millions. For the rest of the year, despite attempts to maintain a lower profile -- he pulled out of Coachella and Rolling Loud headline slots at the last minute -- West remained in the headlines with his continued controversial and inflammatory statements. In 2023, West joined forces with rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a> to form ¥$. The duo released debut single \"Vultures\" in November of that year. They slowly leaked out information about the project in the lead-up to an oft-delayed debut full-length Vultures 1 before finally releasing it in February of 2024. The album, which featured guest appearances from a number of famous artists including <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hcs9uc56yIGFCSy9leWe7\">Lil Durk</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y4inQK6OespitzD6ijMwb\">Freddie Gibbs</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, and many others, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. Though ¥$ initially claimed they would release subsequent chapters Vultures 2 and Vultures 3 as a trilogy at the rate of one album per month, it would be August of 2024 when Vultures 2 finally materialized. The album again included a host of guest appearances, this time making space for collaborations from <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7pFeBzX627ff0VnN6bxPR4\">Desiigner</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:46SHBwWsqBkxI7EeeBEQG7\">Kodak Black</a>, just to name a few. ~ Andy Kellman & Neil Z.

    "biography": "Academy Award and 14-time GRAMMY-winner Lady Gaga is a one-of-a-kind artist and performer. She has amassed an outstanding 110 million global album sales, 175 billion streams, and 758 million song consumption units, making her one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Her most recent pop album, Chromatica, became her sixth consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to achieve this over a ten-year period (2011-2020). Gaga&#39;s collaboration with Ariana Grande on “Rain On Me” had the biggest Spotify debut of 2020, reaching #1 on the Global and US Spotify Charts. In 2023, her debut single “Just Dance” became her third diamond-certified single by the RIAA, joining &#34;Bad Romance&#34; and &#34;Poker Face.&#34; In 2018, she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Shallow,” featured on the soundtrack of Best Picture nominee A Star is Born (2018), in addition to claiming a Golden Globe, a Critics’ Choice Award, and four GRAMMYs for both “Shallow” and “I’ll Never Love Again,” also from the same soundtrack. Lady Gaga knows no bounds, from producing her classic pop hits to exploring the classic American Songbook with her albums Cheek to Cheek and Love For Sale with Tony Bennett, both #1 albums. Beyond music, she excels in business as the founder of Haus Labs and thrives as an actress (A Star Is Born, House of Gucci, Joker: Folie à Deux), as well as a passionate activist for mental health and LGBTQ&#43; rights through her Born This Way Foundation."

    "biography": "Maroon 5 -- and, specifically, its frontman <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Adam Levine</a> -- became the face of blue-eyed soul in the 21st century, managing to navigate shifting trends in music and fashion to be one of the biggest pop bands of their generation. They took the long way to the top, evolving from the straight-ahead '90s rock band <a href=\"spotify:artist:75qhTKV9Lo4yobMuQgSFse\">Kara's Flowers</a> into the sleek, soulful Maroon 5 with 2002's Songs About Jane, an album that languished for two years until \"This Love\" climbed to number five on Billboard's Hot 100 in 2004. From that point forward, the group was a fixture at the top of the charts, their popularity receiving a considerable and enduring boost when <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Levine</a> was cast as a judge on NBC's televised talent competition The Voice in 2011. That year, their <a href=\"spotify:artist:1l7ZsJRRS8wlW3WfJfPfNS\">Christina Aguilera</a> duet \"Moves Like Jagger\" gave Maroon 5 their second number one -- \"Makes Me Wonder\" went to the top in 2007 -- and kicked off a string of Top Ten hits highlighted by the number ones \"One More Night\" and \"Girls Like You,\" a run that helped secure the band a headlining Super Bowl gig in 2019. \"Girls Like You\" featured an appearance by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>, a sign of how Maroon 5 kept current by embracing modern R&B and hip-hop. The band followed this blueprint by enlisting <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a> for \"Beautiful Mistakes,\" a lead single from 2021's Jordi, as well as the 2021 <a href=\"spotify:artist:2FIlpbCgw3KsywBZzuPU1H\">Bantu</a> remix of \"One Light\" and the 2023 single \"Middle Ground.\"\r\n\nPrior to Maroon 5, bandmates <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Adam Levine</a> (vocals/guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboards), Mickey Madden (bass), and Ryan Dusick (drums) had spent the latter half of the '90s playing in <a href=\"spotify:artist:75qhTKV9Lo4yobMuQgSFse\">Kara's Flowers</a>, even releasing a debut album for <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Reprise+Records%22\">Reprise Records</a> while still attending high school. The record tanked, however, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:75qhTKV9Lo4yobMuQgSFse\">Kara's Flowers</a> found themselves dropped from <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Reprise%22\">Reprise</a>'s roster. After briefly attending college, the bandmates regrouped as Maroon 5, adding former <a href=\"spotify:artist:3goqO5kpcQyDlzI1yaRlnV\">Square</a> guitarist James Valentine to the lineup and embracing a more R&B-influenced sound. Several years later, the quintet had officially risen to the forefront of pop music with Songs About Jane and It Won't Be Soon Before Long, both of which went multi-platinum. \r\n\nSongs About Jane propelled the band into the mainstream, but the album was not an immediate hit. <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Octone+Records%22\">Octone Records</a> had signed the newly christened Maroon 5 in 2001, and the debut album Jane received a lukewarm response upon its release in June 2002. \"Harder to Breathe\" became a radio staple 17 months later and was soon followed by the omnipresent \"This Love,\" whose steamy video (featuring frontman <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Levine</a> and a barely clothed girlfriend) wooed the TV-watching crowds at MTV. Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album's release, and follow-up singles like \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Sunday Morning\" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year's end. \r\n\nMaroon 5 toured exhaustively in support of Jane's slow-burning success, issuing two stopgap recordings -- 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live Friday the 13th -- while traveling the world alongside the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:22bE4uQ6baNwSHPVcDxLCe\">the Rolling Stones</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hEurMDQu99nJRq8pTxO14\">John Mayer</a>. Their schedule was especially trying on percussionist Dusick, who sustained wrist and shoulder injuries and was often unable to play. By fall 2006, Dusick had been officially replaced by Matt Flynn (the former drummer for <a href=\"spotify:artist:5DYAABs8rkY9VhwtENoQCz\">Gavin DeGraw</a>), and the revised band released its sophomore effort in May 2007. It Won't Be Soon Before Long proved to be less popular than its predecessor (which had sold more than four million copies in the U.S. alone), but it still enjoyed double-platinum certification while spinning off the chart-topping single \"Makes Me Wonder.\" Maroon 5 had cemented their status as pop/rock heavyweights, and they now had the connections to prove it. Released in late 2008, Call and Response: The Remix Album reinterpreted the band's catalog with remixes by influential producers like <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hv9jJF3adDNsBSIQDqcjp\">Mark Ronson</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>.\r\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, the band worked with a different producer -- veteran rock/country architect <a href=\"spotify:artist:52nLyltGxLUNmtyL5cY707\">Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange</a> -- on a third studio album, Hands All Over, which was released in September 2010. Although it was kept from the top of the album charts, it went platinum. Also, the following year, it received a big boost when <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Levine</a> began appearing as a judge on the NBC reality television talent competition The Voice. That same year, Hands All Over was re-released with the single \"Moves Like Jagger,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Levine</a>'s The Voice co-judge <a href=\"spotify:artist:1l7ZsJRRS8wlW3WfJfPfNS\">Christina Aguilera</a>; the single promptly hit the top of the charts. In 2012, Carmichael revealed that he was taking time off from performing with Maroon 5 and would be replaced by touring keyboardist <a href=\"spotify:artist:2FMOHE79X98yptp4RpPrt7\">PJ Morton</a>.\r\n\nIn April 2012, the band teased the release of its fourth studio album with \"Payphone,\" a single featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:137W8MRPWKqSmrBGDBFSop\">Wiz Khalifa</a> that hit number two. The resulting album, Overexposed, also reached number two, featuring production from a bevy of name producers including <a href=\"spotify:artist:4we5S2VLjgY9KzIzApL1KI\">Ryan Tedder</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>, and more. A second single from the album, the reggae-tinged \"One More Night,\" topped the charts not long after its release in June, and stayed at the top long enough to become the band's most successful showing to date. Two further singles also reached the Top Ten, \"Daylight\" and \"Love Somebody.\" \r\n\nDuring 2013, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bYPcJP5jwMhSivRcqie2n\">Levine</a> continued to appear on The Voice, and also made appearances in the television drama American Horror Story, as well as the music-based dramatic film Begin Again. The band also hit the studio to record songs for a fifth studio album, aptly titled V, which saw keyboardist Jesse Carmichael return to the fold after a brief hiatus. Released in September 2014, V debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and produced several Top Ten singles including \"Maps,\" \"Animals,\" and \"Sugar.\" Two more singles followed in 2015 with \"This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like a Motherf*****\" and \"Feelings.\" Also in 2015, Maroon 5 released their first hits collection, The Singles. \r\n\nThe single \"Don't Wanna Know,\" featuring rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, appeared in 2016 and peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was later revealed to be the first single from their forthcoming sixth LP. A second collaborative single, \"Cold,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, was released in early 2017, with \"What Lovers Do\" appearing before the November release of Red Pill Blues. A reference to the choice of taking either red or blue pills first presented in the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix, Red Pill Blues also featured guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ZED1XzwlLHW4ZaG4lOT6m\">Julia Michaels</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a>, ASAP Rocky, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2iUbk5KhZYZt4CRvWbwb7S\">LunchMoney Lewis</a>. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. In 2018, the band issued a remix of the album track \"Girls You Like,\" featuring an appearance by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>, which wound up being their first single to reach number one on the Billboard charts since 2012's \"One More Night.\"\r\n\nOn February 3, 2019, Maroon 5 headlined the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in Atlanta, Georgia, supported by rappers <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ht3wxeT69CzyKFChNnNAB\">Big Boi</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>. That September, they released \"Memories\" as the lead-single off their seventh studio-album, Jordi. Both the song and the album title were dedicated to the band's late manager, Jordan Feldstein who died in December 2017 from pulmonary embolism. In 2020, bassist Mickey Madden announced he was retiring from the group following an arrest for domestic violence allegations. The band carried on with the topical single \"Nobody's Love,\" which was partly inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests following the murder of George Floyd. They also teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a> for the 2021 single \"Beautiful Mistakes.\" All of this led up to the release of Jordi, which arrived in June 2021, peaking at number 8 on the Billboard 200. A fourth single, \"Lost,\" appeared soon after, charting at 27 on the Pop 100. More tracks followed, including a 2022 remix of \"One Light\" by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2FIlpbCgw3KsywBZzuPU1H\">Bantu</a>, featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:3KNIG74xSTc3dj0TRy7pGX\">Yung Bleu</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3MdXrJWsbVzdn6fe5JYkSQ\">Latto</a>, and 2023's \"Middle Ground,\" the latter of which found the band working with producers <a href=\"spotify:artist:4olE3I5QU0dvSR7LIpqTXc\">Andrew Watt</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50JJSqHUf2RQ9xsHs0KMHg\">Jon Bellion</a>, and Pete Nappi. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi"

On-screen, she has generated mega-fandom through starring roles on television and film. She is signed to Island Records, where she debuted her acclaimed Gold-certified fifth studio album, emails i can’t send, which appeared on many “Best Of 2022” lists including Rolling Stone and Billboard.

Following this, her second single, “Please Please Please,” released in June, soared to #1 on Spotify’s Global and US charts, Apple Music, and eventually the Billboard Hot 100, where it debuted at #2 before reaching #1. In August, she released her highly anticipated sixth studio album, Short n’ Sweet, which instantly received critical acclaim from the likes of the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Variety.

    "biography": "Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira has sold over 80 million records worldwide and won numerous awards including three GRAMMYs and eleven Latin GRAMMYs. At the age of 18, she founded the Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) Foundation which provides education and nutrition to over 6,000 impoverished children in Colombia.\nIn October 2011, Shakira was named a member of President Obama’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. She served as coach on the 4th and 6th season of NBC&#39;s hit reality vocal competition series &quot;The Voice&quot;. Her tenth studio album &quot;Shakira&quot; was released in 2014, featuring hits such as &quot;Can’t Remember to Forget You,&quot; with Rihanna and &quot;La La La (Brazil 2014)&quot; which she performed at the finals of Fifa&#39;s World Cup 2014 in Brazil.\nIn 2016, she starred as Gazelle in Disney’s record-breaking film &quot;Zootopia,&quot; as well as contributing to its soundtrack with &quot;Try Everything&quot;. She also launched &quot;La Bicicleta&quot; with fellow Colombian artist Carlos Vives, which remained #1 for 18 consecutive weeks in Colombia. It was followed up by &quot;Chantaje&quot; feat. Maluma. With over 2 billion views on YouTube, it is one of the platform’s biggest Latin hits in history.\nIn November 2018 she wrapped her hugely successful El Dorado World Tour. 2019 saw the release of the concert film Shakira in Concert: El Dorado World Tour, which was shown in cinemas worldwide for one-night only. She performed at Super Bowl LIV in Miami and is currently working on new music."
